c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c epsode is a driver subroutine for the episode package.
c epsode is to be called once for each output value of t.
c it then makes repeated calls to the core integrator
c subroutine, tstep.
c
c the input parameters are as follows.
c   diffun=  name of double precision subroutine diffun(n,t,y,ydot)
c            which the user must supply and declare external. see
c            note below.
c   pederv=  name of double precision subroutine pederv(n,t,y,pd,n0)
c            which the user must supply and declare external. see
c            note below.
c   n     =  the number of differential equations (used only on
c              first call, unless index = -1).  n must never be
c              increased during a given problem.
c   t0    =  the initial value of t, the independent variable
c              (used for input only on first call).
c   h0    =  the step size in t (used for input only on the
c              first call, unless index = 3 on input).  when
c              index = 3, h0 is the maximum absolute value of
c              the step size to be used.
c   y0    =  a vector of length n containing the initial values of
c              y (used for input only on first call).
c   tout  =  the value of t at which output is desired next.
c              integration will normally go beyond tout and
c              interpolate to t = tout.  (used only for input.)
c   eps   =  the relative error bound (used only on first call,
c              unless index = -1).  this bound is used as follows.
c              let r(i) denote the estimated relative local error
c              in y(i), i.e. the error relative to ymax(i), as
c              measured per step (of size h) or per ss units of t.
c              then eps is a bound on the root-mean-square norm
c              of the vector r, i.e.
c                      n
c              sqrt ( sum ( r(i)**2 )/n ) .lt. eps.
c                     i=1
c              the vector ymax is computed in epsode as described
c              under ierror below.
c              if error control per ss units of t is desired, set ss
c              to a positive number after statement 10 (where it is
c              now set to zero) and update it after statement 60.
c              see also the comments on ss and ymax below.
c  ierror =  the error flag with values and meanings as follow.
c         1    absolute error is controlled.  ymax(i) = 1.0.
c         2    error relative to abs(y) is controlled.  if y(i) = 0.0
c              a divide error will occur.  ymax(i) = abs(y(i)).
c         3    error relative to the largest value of abs(y(i)) seen
c              so far is controlled.  if the initial value of y(i) is
c              0.0, then ymax(i) is set to 1.0 initially and remains
c              at least 1.0.
c   mf    =  the method flag (used only on first call, unless
c              index = -1).  allowed values are 10, 11, 12, 13,
c              20, 21, 22, 23.  mf is an integer with two decimal
c              digits, meth and miter (mf = 10*meth + miter).  (mf
c              can be thought of as the ordered pair (meth,miter).)
c              meth is the basic method indicator.
c                meth = 1 indicates variable-step size, variable-
c                         order adams method, suitable for non-
c                         stiff problems.
c                meth = 2 indicates variable-step size, variable-
c                         order backward differentiation method,
c                         suitable for stiff problems.
c              miter indicates the method of iterative correction
c                (nonlinear system solution).
c                miter = 0 indicates functional iteration (no
c                          partial derivatives needed).
c                miter = 1 indicates a chord or semi-stationary
c                          newton method with closed form (exact)
c                          jacobian, which is computed in the
c                          user supplied subroutine
c                          pederv(n,t,y,pd,n0) described below.
c                miter = 2 indicates a chord  or semi-stationary
c                          newton method with an internally
c                          computed finite difference approximation
c                          to the jacobian.
c                miter = 3 indicates a chord or semi-stationary
c                          newton method with an internally
c                          computed diagonal matrix approximation
c                          to the jacobian, based on a directional
c                          derivative.
c   index =  integer used on input to indicate type of call,
c              with the following values and meanings..
c         1    this is the first call for this problem.
c         0    this is not the first call for this problem,
c              and integration is to continue.
c        -1    this is not the first call for the problem,
c              and the user has reset n, eps, and/or mf.
c         2    same as 0 except that tout is to be hit
c              exactly (no interpolation is done).
c              assumes tout .ge. the current t.
c         3    same as 0 except control returns to calling
c              program after one step.  tout is ignored.
c            since the normal output value of index is 0,
c            it need not be reset for normal continuation.
c
c after the initial call, if a normal return occurred and a normal
c continuation is desired, simply reset tout and call again.
c all other parameters will be ready for the next call.
c a change of parameters with index = -1 can be made after
c either a successful or an unsuccessful return.
c
c the output parameters are as follows.
c   t0    =  the output value of t.  if integration was successful,
c            t0 = tout.  otherwise, t0 is the last value of t
c            reached successfully.
c   h0    =  the step size h used last, whether successfully or not.
c   y0    =  the computed values of y at t = t0.
c   index =  integer used on output to indicate results,
c              with the following values and meanings..
c         0    integration was completed to tout or beyond.
c        -1    the integration was halted after failing to pass the
c              error test even after reducing h by a factor of
c              1.e10 from its initial value.
c        -2    after some initial success, the integration was
c              halted either by repeated error test failures or
c              by a test on eps.  possibly too much accuracy has
c              been requested, or a bad choice of mf was made.
c        -3    the integration was halted after failing to achieve
c              corrector convergence even after reducing h by a
c              factor of 1.e10 from its initial value.
c        -4    immediate halt because of illegal values of input
c              parameters.  see printed message.
c        -5    index was -1 on input, but the desired changes of
c              parameters were not implemented because tout
c              was not beyond t.  interpolation to t = tout was
c              performed as on a normal return.  to continue,
c              simply call again with index = -1 and a new tout.
c        -6    index was 2 on input, but tout was not beyond t.
c              no action was taken.
c
c in addition to epsode, the following subroutines are used by and
c provided in this package:
c   interp(tout,y,n0,y0)  interpolates to give output values at
c                         t = tout  by using data in the y array.
c   tstep(diffun,pederv,y,n0)  is the core integration subroutine, which
c                integrates over a single step and does associated error
c                control.
c   coset  sets coefficients for use in tstep.
c   adjust(y,n0)  adjusts the history array y on reduction of order.
c   pset(diffun,pederv,y,n0,con,miter,ier)  computes and processes the
c                             jacobian matrix, j = df/dy.
c   dec(n,n0,a,ip,ier)  performs the lu decomposition of a matrix.
c   sol(n,n0,a,b,ip)  solves a linear system a*x = b, after dec
c                       has been called for the matrix a.
c note:  pset, dec, and sol are called if and only if miter = 1
c        or miter = 2.
c
c the user must furnish the following double precision subroutines
c      and declare them external in his calling program:
c   diffun(n,t,y,ydot)  computes the function  ydot = f(y,t),
c                       the right hand side of the ordinary
c                       differential equation system, where y
c                       and ydot are vectors of length n.
c   pederv(n,t,y,pd,n0)  computes the n by n jacobian matrix of
c                        partial derivatives and stores it in pd as
c                        an n0 by n0 array.   pd(i,j) is to be set
c                        to the partial derivative of ydot(i) with
c                        respect to y(j).  pederv is called if and
c                        only if miter = 1. for other values of
c                        miter, pederv can be a dummy subroutine.
c
c caution:  at the present time the maximum number of differential
c           equations, which can be solved by episode, is 20.  to
c           change this number to a new value, say nmax, change
c           y(20,13) to y(nmax,13), ymax(20) to ymax(nmax),
c           error(20) to error(nmax), save1(20) to save1(nmax),
c           save2(20) to save2(nmax), pw(400) to pw(nmax*nmax),
c           and ipiv(20) to ipiv(nmax) in the common and dimension
c           statements below.  also change the argument in the
c           if...go to 440 statement (after the common statements)
c           from 20 to nmax.  no other changes need to be made to
c           any other subroutine in this package when the maximum
c           number of equations is changed.  elsewhere, the column
c           length of the y array is n0 instead of 20.  the row
c           length of y can be reduced from 13 to 6 if meth = 2.
c           the array ipiv is used if and only if miter = 1 or
c           miter = 2.  the size of the pw array can be reduced
c           to 1 if miter = 0 or to n if miter = 3.
c
c the common block epcom2 can be accessed externally by the user,
c if he desires to modify the error control behaviour of the package.
c the block contains ymax(20) used to control the error. see above
c and reference (2).
c
c the common block epcom9 can be accessed externally by the user,
c if he desires.  it contains the step size last used successfully
c (hused), the order last used successfully (nqused), the
c number of steps taken so far (nstep), the number of function
c evaluations (diffun calls) so far (nfe), and the number of
c jacobian evaluations so far (nje).

      subroutine tstep (diffun, pederv, y, n0)
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c tstep performs one step of the integration of an initial value
c problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
c communication with tstep is via the following variables..
c
c   y       an n0 by lmax array containing the dependent variables
c             and their scaled derivatives.  lmax is currently 6 for
c             the variable step backward differentiation formulas,
c             and 13 for the variable step adams formulas.
c             (lmax -1) = maxder, the maximum order used.
c             see subroutine coset.  y(i,j+1) contains the
c             j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by h**j/factorial(j)
c             for j = 0,1,...,nq, where nq is the current order.
c   n0      a constant integer .ge. n, used for dimensioning
c             purposes.
c   t       the independent variable, updated on each step taken.
c   h       the step size to be attempted on the next step.
c             h is altered by the error control algorithm during
c             the solution of the problem. h can be either positive
c             or negative, but its sign must remain constant
c             throughout the problem run.
c   hmin,   the minimum and maximum absolute values of the step
c    hmax     size to be used for the step. these may be changed at
c             any time, but the change will not take effect until the
c             next change in h is made.
c   eps     the relative error bound.  see description in
c             subroutine epsode.
c   ss      the size of the time interval to be used for error
c             control.  a default value of 0 is used to produce
c             control of error per step.  see subroutine epsode.
c   uround  the unit of roundoff for the computer being used.
c   n       the number of first order ordinary differential
c             equations being solved.
c   mf      the method flag.  see description in subroutine epsode.
c   kflag   a completion code with the following meanings..
c                     0  the step was succesful.
c                    -1  the requested error could not be achieved
c                          with abs(h) = hmin.
c                    -2  the requested error is smaller than can
c                          be handled for this problem.
c                    -3  corrector convergence could not be
c                          achieved for abs(h) = hmin.
c             on a return with kflag negative, the values of t and
c             the y array are as of the beginning of the last
c             step and h is the last step size attempted.
c   jstart  an integer used on input and output.
c             on input, it has the following values and meanings..
c                     0  perform the first step.
c                 .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
c                 .lt.0  take the next step with a new value of
c                          h and/or mf.
c             on exit, jstart is set to nq, the current order of the
c             method.
c   ymax      an array of n elements with which the estimated local
c               errors in y are compared.
c   error     an array of n elements.  error(i)/tq(2) is the
c               estimated local error in y(i) per ss units of
c               t or per step (of size h).
c   save1,    two arrays for working storage,
c     save2     each of length n.
c   pw        a block of locations used for the partial derivatives
c               of f with respect to y, if miter is not o.  see
c               description in subroutine epsode.
c   ipiv      an integer array of length n, which is used for pivot
c               information for the linear algebraic system in the
c               correction process, when miter = 1 or 2.

c coset is called by tstep and sets coefficients for use there.
c
c for each order nq, the coefficients in el are calculated by use of
c  the generating polynomial lambda(x), with coefficients el(i):
c      lambda(x) = el(1) + el(2)*x + ... + el(nq+1)*(x**nq).
c for the backward differentiation formulas,
c                    nq
c      lambda(x) = product (1 + x/xi(i) ) .
c                   i = 1
c for the adams formulas,
c                              nq-1
c      (d/dx) lambda(x) = c * product (1 + x/xi(i) ) ,
c                              i = 1
c      lambda(-1) = 0,    lambda(0) = 1,
c where c is a normalization constant.
c in both cases, xi(i) is defined by
c      h*xi(i) = t sub n  -  t sub (n-i)
c              = h + tau(1) + tau(2) + ... tau(i-1).
c
c coset also sets maxder, the maximum order of the formulas
c available. currently this is 5 for the backward differentiation
c formulas, and 12 for the adams formulas.  to use different
c values (.le. 13),  change the numbers in statements 1 and 2 below.
c
c in addition to variables described previously, communication
c with coset uses the following..
c   tau    = a vector of length 13 containing the past nq values
c            of h.
c   el     = a vector of length 13 in which coset stores the
c            coefficients for the corrector formula.
c   tq     = a vector of length 5 in which coset stores constants
c            used for the convergence test, the error test, and
c            selection of h at a new order.
c   lmax   = maxder + 1, where maxder is the maximum order
c            available.  lmax is the maximum number of columns
c            of the y array to be used.
c   meth   = the basic method indicator.
c   nq     = the current order.
c   l      = nq + 1, the length of the vector stored in el, and
c            the number of columns of the y array being used.
c   nqindx = a counter controlling the frequency of order changes.
c            an order change is about to be considered if
c            nqindx = 1.
