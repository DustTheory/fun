Portugal
Portugal, officially the Portuguese Republic
(Portuguese: República Portuguesa [ʁɛˈpuβlikɐ
puɾtuˈɣezɐ]), [note 4] is a country whose mainland is
located on the Iberian Peninsula of Southwestern
Europe, and whose territory also includes the Atlantic
archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira. It features
the westernmost point in continental Europe, and its
Iberian portion is bordered to the west and south by
the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by
Spain, the sole country to have a land border with
Portugal. Its two archipelagos form two autonomous
regions with their own regional governments. Lisbon
is the capital and largest city by population.
Portugal is the oldest continuously existing nation
state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in
Europe, its territory having been continuously settled,
invaded and fought over since prehistoric times. It
was inhabited by pre-Celtic and Celtic peoples who
had contact with Phoenicians and Ancient Greek
traders, it was ruled by the Romans, followed by the
invasions of the Suebi and Visigothic Germanic
peoples, in turn followed by the Moors who
eventually were expelled. Portugal as a county was
established during the early Christian Reconquista.
Founded in 868, the County of Portugal gained
prominence after the Battle of São Mamede (1128).
The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed
following the Battle of Ourique (1139), and
independence from León was recognized by the
Treaty of Zamora (1143). [14]
In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal established
the first global maritime and commercial empire,
becoming one of the world's major economic,
political and military powers. [15] During this period,
today referred to as the Age of Discovery,
Portuguese explorers pioneered maritime exploration
with the discovery of what would become Brazil
(1500). During this time Portugal monopolized the
spice trade, divided the world into hemispheres of
dominion with Castile, and the empire expanded with
military campaigns in Asia. By the 18th century
however, events such as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake,
the country's occupation during the Napoleonic Wars

Etymology
The word Portugal derives from the Roman-Celtic place name
Portus Cale; [26] a city where present-day Porto and Vila Nova de
Gaia (New village in Gaia) now stand, at the mouth of the River
Douro in the north of what is now Portugal. The name of the city is
from the Latin word for port or harbour, portus, but the second
element of Portus Cale is less clear. The mainstream explanation
for the name is that it is an ethnonym derived from the Castro
people, also known as the Callaeci, Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who
occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. [27] The names
Cale and Callaici are the origin of today's Gaia and Galicia. [28][29]
Chalcolithic Dolmen Anta da Arca
Another theory proposes that Cale or Calle is a derivation of the
Celtic word for 'port', like the Irish caladh or Scottish Gaelic cala. These explanations, would require the
pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted
because the region's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic, usually considered P-Celtic. However,
scholars like Jean Markale and Tranoy propose that the Celtic branches all share the same origin, and
placenames such as Cale, Gal, Gaia, Calais, Galatia, Galicia, Gaelic, Gael, Gaul, Wales, Cornwall,
Wallonia and others all stem from one linguistic root. [28][30][31]
Another theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the Gaelic
Cailleach, a supernatural hag). Some French scholars believe the name may have come from Portus
Gallus, [32] the port of the Gauls or Celts.
Around 200 BC, the Romans took the Iberian Peninsula from the Carthaginians during the Second Punic
War. In the process they conquered Cale, renaming it Portus Cale ('Port of Cale') and incorporating it in the
province of Gaellicia with its capital in Bracara Augusta (modern day Braga, Portugal). During the Middle
Ages, the region around Portus Cale became known by the Suebi and Visigoths as Portucale. The name
Portucale evolved into Portugale during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was
used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and Minho. By the 11th and 12th centuries,
Portugale, Portugallia, Portvgallo or Portvgalliae was already referred to as Portugal.
The 14th-century Middle French name for the country, Portingal, which added an intrusive /n/ sound
through the process of excrescence, spread to Middle English. [33] Middle English variant spellings included
Portingall, Portingale, [note 5] Portyngale and Portingaill. [33][35] The spelling Portyngale is found in
Chaucer's Epilogue to the Nun's Priest's Tale. These variants survive in the Torrent of Portyngale, a Middle
English romance composed around 1400, and "Old Robin of Portingale", an English Child ballad.
Portingal and variants were also used in Scots [33] and survive in the Cornish name for the country,
Portyngal.
History
PrehistoryThe early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the Iberian
Peninsula located in south-western Europe. The name of Portugal
derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name Portus Cale. The
region was settled by Pre-Celts and Celts, giving origin to peoples
like the Gallaeci, Lusitanians, [36] Celtici and Cynetes (also known
as Conii), [37] visited by Phoenicians-Carthaginians and Ancient
Greeks, was incorporated in the Roman Republic dominions as
Lusitania and part of Gallaecia, after 45 BC until 298 AD.
The region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by Neanderthals
and then by Homo sapiens, who roamed the border-less region of
the northern Iberian peninsula. [38] These were subsistence societies
and although they did not establish prosperous settlements, they did
form organized societies. Neolithic Portugal experimented with domestication of herding animals, the
raising of some cereal crops and fluvial or marine fishing. [38]
Prehistoric Rock Art Sites in the Côa
Valley
It is believed by some scholars that early in the first millennium BC,
several waves of Celts invaded Portugal from Central Europe and
inter-married with the local populations, forming different tribes. [39]
Another theory suggests that Celts inhabited western Iberia /
Portugal well before any large Celtic migrations from Central
Europe. [40] In addition, a number of linguists expert in ancient
Celtic have presented compelling evidence that the Tartessian
language, once spoken in parts of SW Spain and SW Portugal, is at
least proto-Celtic in structure. [41]
Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar,
built in the 3rd millennium BCE
Modern archaeology and research shows a Portuguese root to the
Celts in Portugal and elsewhere. [42] During that period and until the
Roman invasions, the Castro culture (a variation of the Urnfield
culture also known as Urnenfelderkultur) was prolific in Portugal and modern Galicia. [43][44][29] This
culture, together with the surviving elements of the Atlantic megalithic culture [45] and the contributions that
come from the more Western Mediterranean cultures, ended up in what has been called the Cultura Castreja
or Castro Culture. [46][47] This designation refers to the characteristic Celtic populations called 'dùn', 'dùin'
or 'don' in Gaelic and that the Romans called castrae in their chronicles. [48]
Based on the Roman chronicles about the Callaeci peoples, along with the Lebor Gabála Érenn [49]
narrations and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of
Portugal and Galicia, it is possible to infer that there was a matriarchal society, with a military and religious
aristocracy probably of the feudal type. The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal),
of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and
religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous
due to the ability of the druids to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the
transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.
The first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military
campaigns such as Strabo, Herodotus and Pliny the Elder among others, about the social organization, and
describing the inhabitants of these territories, the Gallaeci of Northern Portugal as:
"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the
moon."There were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the
Lusitanians; the core area of these people lay in inland central
Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the
Celtici of Alentejo, and the Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve. Among
the tribes or sub-divisions were the Bracari, Coelerni, Equaesi, Grovii,
Interamici, Leuni, Luanqui, Limici, Narbasi, Nemetati, Paesuri,
Quaquerni, Seurbi, Tamagani, Tapoli, Turduli, Turduli Veteres,
Turdulorum Oppida, Turodi, and Zoelae. A few small, semi-
permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as Tavira) were also
founded in the Algarve region by Phoenicians–Carthaginians.
Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia
Roman Temple of Évora, in the
Alentejo, is one of the best-
preserved Roman-built structures in
the country.
Romans first invaded the
Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC.
The Carthaginians, Rome's
adversary in the Punic Wars,
were expelled from their
coastal colonies. During the
last days of Julius Caesar,
almost the entire peninsula
was annexed to the Roman
Republic.
Examples of Castro culture in
Northern Portugal (9th – 1st c.
BCE): Citânia de Briteiros (top)
and Cividade de Terroso (bottom)
The Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost
two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and the
lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave
mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a
rebellion began in the north. The Lusitanians and other native tribes, under the leadership of
Viriathus, [50][51] wrested control of all of western Iberia.
Rome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell
the rebellion, but to no avail – the Lusitanians kept conquering
territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They
bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was
assassinated and Tautalus became leader of the Lusitanians.
Rome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of
Lusitania only took place in the Visigothic era.
In 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of Roman province. Later, a
northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as Gallaecia, with
capital in Bracara Augusta, today's Braga. [52] There are still many
ruins of castros (hill forts) throughout modern Portugal and remains of
the Castro culture. Some urban remains are quite large, like
Conímbriga and Mirobriga. The former, beyond being one of the
largest Roman settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a National
Monument. Conímbriga lies 16 kilometres (10 miles) from Coimbra,
which in turn was the ancient Aeminium. The site also has a museum
that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.
Centum Cellas, in the Beira
region, is a Roman villa rustica
from the 1st century CE.Several works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes
are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of
ceramics, were also found. Contemporary historians include Paulus Orosius (c. 375–418) [53] and Hydatius
(c. 400–469), bishop of Aquae Flaviae, who reported on the final years of the Roman rule and arrival of the
Germanic tribes.
Germanic kingdoms: Suebi and Visigoths
In the early 5th century, Germanic tribes, namely the Suebi [54] and the
Vandals (Silingi and Hasdingi) together with their allies, the
Sarmatians and Alans invaded the Iberian Peninsula where they would
form their kingdom. The Kingdom of the Suebi [55] was the Germanic
post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of
Gallaecia-Lusitania. 5th-century vestiges of Alan settlements were
found in Alenquer (from old Germanic Alan kerk, temple of the
Alans), Coimbra and Lisbon. [56]
About 410 and during the 6th century it became a formally declared
Kingdom of the Suebi, [55][54] where king Hermeric made a peace
treaty with the Gallaecians before passing his domains to Rechila, his
Map of the Kingdom of the Suebi
son. In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to Rechiar.
in the 5th and 6th centuries
After the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was
divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both
reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457–459)
reunified the kingdom. He was assassinated after a failed Roman-
Visigothic conspiracy. Although the conspiracy did not achieve its
true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between
two kings: Frumar (Frumario 459–463) and Remismund
(Remismundo, son of Maldras) (459–469) who would re-reunify
his father's kingdom in 463. He would be forced to adopt Arianism
in 465 due to the Visigoth influence. By 500, the Visigothic
Kingdom had been installed in Iberia, it was based in Toledo and
advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.
After the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where
Visigothic kingdom in Iberia c. 560
virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted
until 550. The only thing known about this period is that
Theodemund (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians. The dark period ended with the reign of
Karriarico (550–559) who reinstalled Catholic Christianity in 550. He was succeeded by Theodemar (559–
570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.
The councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian
parish) and the Christianization of the pagan population (De correctione rusticorum) under the auspices of
Saint Martin of Braga (São Martinho de Braga). [57]
After the death of Teodomiro, Miro (570–583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of
Braga (572) was held. The Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also
organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation
Miro died.In the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take
place. Eborico (Eurico, 583–584) was dethroned by Andeca
(Audeca 584–585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion
led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585,
turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth
province of the Gothic kingdom. [58] Leovigild was crowned King
of Gallaecia, Hispania and Gallia Narbonensis.
For the next 300 years and by the
year 700, the entire Iberian

Visigoths. [59][60][61][62][63] Under
the Visigoths, Gallaecia was a well-
defined space governed by a doge
of its own. Doges at this time were related to the monarchy and acted as
princes in all matters. Both 'governors' Wamba and Wittiza (Vitiza) acted as
doge (they would later become kings in Toledo). These two became known
as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the
Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in
711. King Roderic (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus
becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia. From the various Germanic
Suebi King Miro and St.
groups who settled in western Iberia, the Suebi left the strongest lasting
Martin of Braga; c. 1145
cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of
Asturias. [64][65][66] According to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of
living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail,
distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal. Bracara Augusta, the modern city of Braga and
former capital of Gallaecia, became the capital of the Suebi. [57] Apart from cultural and some linguistic
traces, the Suebians left the highest Germanic genetic contribution of the Iberian Peninsula in Portugal and
Galicia. [67] Orosius, at that time resident in Hispania, shows a rather pacific initial settlement, the
newcomers working their lands [68] or serving as bodyguards of the locals. [69] Another Germanic group that
accompanied the Suebi and settled in Gallaecia were the Buri. They settled in the region between the rivers
Cávado and Homem, in the area known as Terras de Bouro (Lands of the Buri). [70]
Islamic period and the Reconquista
Today's continental Portugal, along with most of modern
Spain, was part of al-Andalus between 726 and 1249,
following the Umayyad Caliphate conquest of the Iberian
Peninsula. This rule lasted from some decades in the North to
five centuries in the South. [71]
The Caliphate of Cordoba in the early 10th
century
After defeating the Visigoths in only a few months, the
Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the
peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal
became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of
Damascus, which stretched from the Indus river in the Indian
sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in
750. That year the west of the empire gained its
independence under Abd-ar-Rahman I with the establishmentof the Emirate of Córdoba. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the Caliphate of Córdoba in
929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called Taifa
kingdoms. [71]
The governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves Emir of
their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the
Christian kingdoms of the north. Most of present-day Portugal fell
into the hands of the Taifa of Badajoz of the Aftasid Dynasty, and
after a short spell of an ephemeral Taifa of Lisbon in 1022, fell
under the dominion of the Taifa of Seville of the Abbadids poets.
The Taifa period ended with the conquest of the Almoravids who
came from Morocco in 1086 winning a decisive victory at the
Battle of Sagrajas, followed a century later in 1147, after the second
Statue of Ibn Qasi outside the Castle
period of Taifa, by the Almohads, also from Marrakesh. [72] Al-
of Mértola, in the Alentejo
Andaluz was divided into different districts called Kura. Gharb Al-
Andalus at its largest consisted of ten kuras, [73] each with a distinct
capital and governor. The main cities of the period in Portugal were in the southern half of the country:
Beja, Silves, Alcácer do Sal, Santarém and Lisbon. The Muslim population of the region consisted mainly
of native Iberian converts to Islam (the so-called Muwallad or Muladi) and Arabs. The Arabs were
principally noblemen from Syria and Oman; and though few in numbers, they constituted the elite of the
population. The Berbers were originally from the Rif and Atlas mountains region of North Africa and were
nomads. [71]
County of Portugal
An Asturian Visigothic noble named Pelagius of Asturias in 718 was
elected leader [74] by many of the ousted Visigoth nobles. Pelagius called
for the remnant of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the
Moors and regroup in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands,
better known today as the Cantabrian Mountains, in what is today the
small mountain region in north-western Spain, adjacent to the Bay of
Biscay. [75]
A statue of Count Vímara
Peres, first Count of Portugal
Pelagius' plan was to use the Cantabrian mountains as a place of refuge
and protection from the invading Moors. He then aimed to regroup the
Iberian Peninsula's Christian armies and use the Cantabrian mountains as
a springboard from which to regain their lands. In the process, after
defeating the Moors in the Battle of Covadonga in 722, Pelagius was
proclaimed king, thus founding the Christian Kingdom of Asturias and
starting the war of Christian reconquest known in Portuguese as the
Reconquista Cristã. [75]
At the end of the 9th century, the region of Portugal, between the rivers
Minho and Douro, was reconquered from the Moors by the nobleman and
knight Vímara Peres on the orders of King Alfonso III of Asturias. Finding that the region had previously
had two major cities – Portus Cale in the coast and Braga in the interior, with many towns that were now
deserted – he decided to repopulate and rebuild them with Portuguese and Galician refugees and other
Christians. [76] Apart from the Arabs from the South, the coastal regions in the North were also attacked by
Norman and Viking [77][78] raiders mainly from 844. The last great invasion, through the Minho (river),
ended with the defeat of Olaf II Haraldsson in 1014 against the Galician nobility who also stopped further
advances into the County of Portugal.Count Vímara Peres [79] organized the region he had reconquered,
and elevated it to the status of County, naming it the County of
Portugal after the region's major port city – Portus Cale or modern
Porto. One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is
Vimaranes, known today as Guimarães – the "birthplace of the
Portuguese nation" or the "cradle city" (Cidade Berço in
Portuguese). [76]
After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several
counties that made up the Kingdom of Asturias, King Alfonso III
of Asturias knighted Vímara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of
Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as Portucale,
Portugale, and simultaneously Portugália – the County of
Portugal. [76]
Alfonso VI of León investing Henry,
Count of Portugal, in 1093
Later the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of
Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the king's offspring.
With the forced abdication of Alfonso III "the Great" of Asturias by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of
Asturias split into three separate kingdoms. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the
crown of León.
In 1093, Alfonso VI of León bestowed the county to Henry of Burgundy and married him to his
illegitimate daughter, Teresa of León, for his role in reconquering the land from Moors. Henry based his
newly formed county in Bracara Augusta (modern Braga), capital city of the ancient Roman province, and
also previous capital of several kingdoms over the first millennia.
Independence and Afonsine era
On 24 June 1128, the Battle of São Mamede occurred near
Guimarães. Afonso Henriques, Count of Portugal, defeated his mother
Countess Teresa and her lover Fernão Peres de Trava, thereby
establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso then turned his arms against
the Moors in the south.
The Battle of Ourique, 1139
The siege of Lisbon, 1147
Afonso's campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he
obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and
straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of Portugal by his
soldiers. This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of
Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of León, was transformed into the
independent Kingdom of Portugal.
Afonso then established the first of the Portuguese Cortes at Lamego,
where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the
validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth
created during the Portuguese Restoration War. Afonso was
recognized in 1143 by King Alfonso VII of León, and in 1179 by
Pope Alexander III.
During the Reconquista period, Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from Moorish domination.
Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military monastic orders, pushed southward to drive out the
Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended withthe capture of the Algarve and complete expulsion of the last Moorish
settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders,
with minor exceptions.
In one of these situations of conflict with the kingdom of Castile, Dinis I
of Portugal signed with the king Fernando IV of Castile (who was
represented, when a minor, by his mother the queen Maria de Molina) the
Treaty of Alcañices (1297), which stipulated that Portugal abolished
agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant
Juan de Castilla. This treaty established among other things the border
demarcation between the kingdom of Portugal and the kingdom of Leon,
where the disputed town of Olivenza was included.
The reigns of Dinis I (Denis I), Afonso IV (Alphons IV), and Pedro I
(Peter I) for the most part saw peace with the Christian kingdoms of
Iberia.
In 1348 and 1349 Portugal, like the rest of Europe, was devastated by the
Black Death. [80] In 1373, Portugal made an alliance with England, which
is one of the oldest standing alliances in the world. Over time, this went
far beyond geo-political and military cooperation (protecting both nations'
interests in Africa, the Americas and Asia against French, Spanish and
Dutch rivals) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the
two old European allies. In the Oporto region, in particular, there is visible
English influence to this day.
Afonso Henriques was the
last Count of Portugal and the
first King of Portugal after
winning the Battle of Ourique
in 1139.
Joanine era and Age of Discoveries
In 1383, John I of Castile, husband of Beatrice of Portugal and son-in-
law of Ferdinand I of Portugal, claimed the throne of Portugal. A
faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later
King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno Álvares
Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this
battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.
John I of Portugal's victory at the
Battle of Aljubarrota secured the
House of Aviz's claim to the
throne.
Batalha Monastery was erected
by King John I to commemorate
his victory in the 1383–1385
Crisis against Castile.
The new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the
limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring
works of literature, like the Crónicas d'el Rei D. João I by Fernão
Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinança de bem
cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of
Portugal [81][82][83] and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De
Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of
Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa
Benfeytoria. [84] In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal
power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation,
organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in
Portugal: the Ordenações d'el Rei D. Duarte, [85] which was never
enforced; the Ordenações Afonsinas, whose application and
enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordenações
Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach everycorner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da
Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture
in the 16th century.
Portugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the
Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During
this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores,
Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an
eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean,
established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime
trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.
In 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous
Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the
Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.
In 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of
Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so. [86]
Throughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of
Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable
commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a
route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.
The Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been
created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope
Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7
June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe
between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape
Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).
In 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and
became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic
prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and
helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese
explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the
town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long
before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of
many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas. [87][88][89]
In 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for
Portugal. [90] Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in
India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in
Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in
the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach
Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as
Taiwan, Japan, the island of Timor, and in the Moluccas.
Henry the Navigator
Vasco da Gama
Although for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first
Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the
Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521. [91][92][93] From 1519 to 1522, Ferdinand Magellan(Fernão de Magalhães) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first
circumnavigation of the globe. Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the
Philippines in 1521.
The Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian
to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.
All these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the
15th century until the late 16th century.
Iberian Union, Restoration and early Brigantine era
Portugal voluntarily entered a dynastic union
between 1580 and 1640. This occurred
because the last two kings of the House of
Aviz – King Sebastian, who died in the battle
of Alcácer Quibir in Morocco, and his great-
uncle and successor, King-Cardinal Henry of
Portugal – both died without heirs, resulting in
the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580.
Subsequently, Philip II of Spain claimed the
throne and was accepted as Philip I of
Portugal. Portugal did not lose its formal
independence, briefly forming a union of
kingdoms. At this time Spain was a geographic territory. [94] The joining of the two crowns deprived
Portugal of an independent foreign policy and led to its involvement in the Eighty Years' War between
Spain and the Netherlands.
Areas across the world that were, at one point in their
history, part of the Portuguese Empire
War led to a deterioration of the relations with Portugal's oldest ally, England, and the loss of Hormuz, a
strategic trading post located between Iran and Oman. From 1595 to 1663 the Dutch-Portuguese War
primarily involved the Dutch companies invading many Portuguese colonies and commercial interests in
Brazil, Africa, India and the Far East, resulting in the loss of the Portuguese Indian sea trade monopoly. In
1640, John IV of Portugal spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king.
The Portuguese Restoration War ended the sixty-year period of the Iberian Union under the House of
Habsburg. This was the beginning of the House of Braganza, which reigned in Portugal until 1910.
King John IV's eldest son came to reign as Afonso VI, however his physical and mental disabilities left him
overpowered by Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor. In a palace coup organized by
the King's wife, Maria Francisca of Savoy, and his brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja, King Afonso VI was
declared mentally incompetent and exiled first to the Azores and then to the Royal Palace of Sintra, outside
Lisbon. After Afonso's death, Pedro came to the throne as King Pedro II. Pedro's reign saw the
consolidation of national independence, imperial expansion, and investment in domestic production.
Pedro II's son, John V, saw a reign characterized by the influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury,
supplied largely by the royal fifth (a tax on precious metals) that was received from the Portuguese colonies
of Brazil and Maranhão.
Disregarding traditional Portuguese institutions of governance, John V acted as an absolute monarch, nearly
depleting the country's tax revenues on ambitious architectural works, most notably Mafra Palace, and on
commissions and additions for his sizeable art and literary collections.Owing to his craving for international diplomatic recognition, John
also spent large sums on the embassies he sent to the courts of Europe,
the most famous being those he sent to Paris in 1715 and Rome in
1716.
Official estimates – and most estimates made so far – place the number
of Portuguese migrants to Colonial Brazil during the gold rush of the
18th century at 600,000. [95] This represented one of the largest
movements of European populations to their colonies in the Americas
during colonial times.

effectively ruled Portugal as an
enlightened despot during the
reign of King Joseph I.

John V, however, was not
pleased and recalled Carvalho e
Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son,
Joseph I, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of
Carvalho e Melo, and with the Queen Mother's approval, he appointed
Carvalho e Melo as Minister of Foreign Affairs.
As the King's confidence in Carvalho e Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the
state. By 1755, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British
economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented
similar economic policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in mainland Portugal and in the Portuguese
colonies in India, reorganized the army and the navy, restructured the University of Coimbra, and ended
legal discrimination against different Christian sects in Portugal by abolishing the distinction between Old
and New Christians.
Carvalho e Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies
and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He created one of the first appellation systems in the world
by demarcating the region for production of Port to ensure the wine's quality; and this was the first attempt
to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon
all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a
widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes,
especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.
Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when Lisbon was struck by a violentThe 1755 Lisbon earthquake devastated Portugal with an estimated magnitude between 8.5 and 9.0.
earthquake with an estimated moment magnitude of 8.5–9. The city was razed to the ground by the
earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and ensuing fires. [96] Carvalho e Melo survived by a stroke of luck
and then immediately embarked on rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: "What now? We bury the
dead and take care of the living."
Despite the calamity and huge death toll, Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was
already being rebuilt. The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes.
Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by having troops
march around the models. The buildings and large squares of the Pombaline Downtown still remain as one
of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Carvalho e Melo also made an important contribution to the study of
seismology by designing a detailed inquiry on the effects of the earthquake, the Parochial Memories of
1758, that was sent to every parish in the country; this wealth of information allows modern scientists to
reconstruct the event with some degree of scientific precision while also giving current historians an
immense amount of demographic, topographic and prosopographic information on the rest of the kingdom
as well as information on its urban and rural areas.
Following the earthquake, Joseph I gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Carvalho de Melo
became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter
disputes with the upper nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted
assassination. The Távora family and the Duke of Aveiro were implicated and summarily executed after a
quick trial. The following year, the Jesuits were suppressed and expelled from the country and their assets
confiscated by the crown. Carvalho e Melo spared none involved, even women and children (notably,
eight-year-old Leonor de Almeida Portugal, imprisoned in a convent for nineteen years). This was the final
stroke that crushed all opposition by publicly demonstrating even the aristocracy was powerless before the
King's loyal minister. Joseph I ennobled Carvalho e Melo as Count of Oeiras in 1759.
In 1762, Spain invaded Portuguese territory as part of the Seven Years' War, but by 1763 the status quo
between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.
Following the Távora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Further titled "Marquês de
Pombal" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1777.
The new ruler, Queen Maria I of Portugal, disliked the Marquês de Pombal because of the power he
amassed, and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the Távora family, and upon
her accession to the throne, she withdrew all his political offices. The Marquês de Pombal was banished to
his estate at Pombal, where he died in 1782.
However, historians also argue that Pombal's "enlightenment," while far-reaching, was primarily a
mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for
crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well asintensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit. [97]
Napoleonic era
With the invasions by Napoleon, Portugal began a slow but inexorable
decline that lasted until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by
the independence of Brazil, the country's largest colonial possession.
The Departure of the Portuguese
Royal Court to Brazil in 1808
Allegory of the Virtues of Prince
Regent John; D. Sequeira, 1810
In the autumn of 1807, Napoleon moved French troops through Spain
to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces
successfully fought against the French invasion of Portugal in the
Peninsular War, during which the royal family and the Portuguese
nobility, including Maria I, relocated to the Portuguese territory of
Brazil, at that time a colony of the Portuguese Empire, in South
America. This episode is known as the Transfer of the Portuguese
Court to Brazil.
In 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, João VI of Portugal,
the Prince Regent, transferred his court to Brazil and established Rio
de Janeiro as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was
declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it,
forming a pluricontinental state, the United Kingdom of Portugal,
Brazil and the Algarves.
As a result of the change in its
status and the arrival of the
Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, economical,
military, educational, and scientific apparatus were expanded and
highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought
against the French Invasion of Portugal and by 1815 the situation in
Europe had cooled down sufficiently that João VI would have been
able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal
remained in Brazil until the Liberal Revolution of 1820, which started
in Porto, demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.
Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son Pedro in charge of Brazil.
When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to
return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with
the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared Brazil's
independence from Portugal. Cisplatina (today's sovereign state of
Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of
Brazil under Portuguese rule.
The frontispiece of the 1826
Portuguese Constitution featuring
King-Emperor Pedro IV and his
daughter Queen Maria II
Brazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor
Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of Emperor of Brazil. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious
questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a
Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro
abdicated in favour of his daughter, Maria II (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, Infante Miguel, claimed
the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King
Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the Liberal Wars to
reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with
Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.Constitutional monarchy

Republic (1910)
Queen Maria II (Mary II) and King Ferdinand II's son, King Pedro V (Peter V) modernized the country
during his short reign (1853–1861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and
improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the cholera outbreak of
1853–1856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he
died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers Infante
Fernando and Infante João, Duke of Beja, and his wife, Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Pedro not
having children, his brother, Luís I of Portugal (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his
modernization.
At the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South
America and all but a few bases in Asia. Luanda, Benguela, Bissau, Lourenço Marques, Porto Amboim
and the Island of Mozambique were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African
territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into
nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.
With the Conference of Berlin of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally
established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent
from rivalries enticed by the Scramble for Africa. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like Nova Lisboa,
Sá da Bandeira, Silva Porto, Malanje, Tete, Vila Junqueiro, Vila Pery and Vila Cabral were founded or
redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like Beira, Moçâmedes, Lobito, João
Belo, Nacala and Porto Amélia were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks
as the Benguela railway in Angola, and the Beira railway in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal
areas and selected inland regions.
Other episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the 1890 British Ultimatum.
This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of
Mozambique and Angola (most of present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia), which had been claimed byPortugal and included in its "Pink Map", which clashed with British aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo
Railway.
The Portuguese territories in Africa were Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Portuguese Guinea, Angola,
and Mozambique. The tiny fortress of São João Baptista de Ajudá on the coast of Dahomey, was also
under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of Portuguese India, Portuguese
Timor and Portuguese Macau.
On 1 February 1908, King Dom Carlos I of Portugal and his heir apparent and his eldest son, Prince Royal
Dom Luís Filipe, Duke of Braganza, were assassinated in Lisbon in the Terreiro do Paço by two
Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, Alfredo Luís da Costa and Manuel Buíça. Under his rule,
Portugal had been declared bankrupt twice – first on 14 June 1892, and then again on 10 May 1902 –
causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His
second and youngest son, Manuel II of Portugal, became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by
the 5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution, which abolished the monarchy and installed a
republican government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into exile in London, England.
First Republic and Estado Novo
The new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45
different governments in just 15 years. During World War 1
(1914–1918), Portugal helped the Allies fight the Central
Powers, however the war hurt its weak economy. Political
instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for
chaos and unrest during the First Portuguese Republic. These
conditions would lead to the failed Monarchy of the North,
28 May 1926 coup d'état, and the creation of the National
Dictatorship (Ditadura Nacional). This in turn led to the
establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the Estado
Novo under António de Oliveira Salazar in 1933.

José de Almeida, and Prime Minister

Portugal remained neutral in World War II. From the 1940s
to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of NATO,
OECD and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).
Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the
overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with Angola and Mozambique, as the largest and richest
overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's
status as a transcontinental nation and not as a colonial empire.
After India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, with the
support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organizations, separated the territories
of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954. [98] In 1961, Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá's
annexation by the Republic of Dahomey was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the
centuries-old Portuguese Empire.
According to the census of 1921 São João Baptista de Ajudá had five inhabitants and, at the moment of the
ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only two inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.
Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to
relinquish the territories of Goa, Daman and Diu in India. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were
involved in armed conflict in its colony of Portuguese India against the Indian Armed Forces.The operations resulted in the defeat and surrender of the limited
Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a
much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining
Portuguese territories in the Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese
regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed
territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National
Assembly until the military coup of 1974.
Also in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese
overseas provinces of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea in Africa,
resulted in the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974).
António de Oliveira Salazar ruled
Portugal from 1932 to 1968,
within the Estado Novo regime.
Throughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with
increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions
imposed by most of the international community. However, the
authoritarian and conservative Estado Novo regime, first installed and
governed by António de Oliveira Salazar and from 1968 onwards led
by Marcelo Caetano, tried to preserve a vast centuries-long
intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071 km 2
(837,097 sq mi). [99]
Carnation Revolution and European integration
The Portuguese government and army resisted the decolonization of its
overseas territories until April 1974, when a left-wing military coup in
Lisbon, known as the Carnation Revolution, led the way for the
independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as
for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period
known as PREC (Processo Revolucionário Em Curso). This period
was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left-
and right-wing political forces. By the summer of 1975, the tension
between these was so high, that the country was on the verge of civil
war. The forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched a further
coup d'état on 25 November but the Group of Nine, a moderate
military faction, immediately initiated a counter-coup. The main
Portuguese Africa before
episode of this confrontation was the successful assault on the barracks
independence in 1975
of the left-wing dominated Military Police Regiment by the moderate
forces of the Commando Regiment, resulting in three soldiers killed in
action. The Group of Nine emerged victorious, thus preventing the establishment of a communist state in
Portugal and ending the period of political instability in the country. The retreat from the overseas territories
and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations,
which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from
Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique). [100][101]
Over one million Portuguese refugees fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually
not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. Mário
Soares and António de Almeida Santos were charged with organizing the independence of Portugal's
overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its
first democratic elections in 50 years.Portugal continued to be governed by a Junta de Salvação Nacional until the Portuguese legislative election
of 1976. It was won by the Portuguese Socialist Party (PS) and Mário Soares, its leader, became Prime
Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. Mário Soares would be Prime Minister from
1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth
and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of
the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the European Economic Community (EEC) by
starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.
Mário Soares became Portugal's
first democratically elected prime
minister in 1976.
After the transition to democracy, Portugal bounced between socialism
and adherence to the neoliberal model. Land reform and
nationalizations were enforced; the Portuguese Constitution (approved
in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and
communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and
1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to
socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a socialist
economy. Portugal's economic situation after the revolution obliged the
government to pursue International Monetary Fund (IMF)-monitored
stabilization programmes in 1977–78 and 1983–85.
In 1986, Portugal, along with Spain, joined the European Economic
Community (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the
following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU structural and cohesion
funds and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.
Portugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, Macau, was peacefully handed over to the People's
Republic of China (PRC) on 20 December 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for
Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of East Timor (Asia) was formally
recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the
Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an Indonesian armed invasion and occupation.
On 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement
Schengen Area rules, eliminating border controls
with other Schengen members while simultaneously
strengthening border controls with non-member
states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the
Community of Portuguese Language Countries
(CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, Jorge
Sampaio became president. He won re-election in
January 2001. Expo '98 took place in Portugal and in
1999 it was one of the founding countries of the euro
and the eurozone. On 5 July 2004, José Manuel

the most powerful office in the European Union. On
1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into
force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the
Jerónimos Monastery, in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and
improving the coherence of its action. Ireland was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the
Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.
Economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in government debt during the financial crisis of 2007–
2008 led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the European
Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), a loan to helpthe country stabilize its finances.
Geography
The territory of Portugal includes an area on the Iberian Peninsula
(referred to as the continent by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos
in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores. It
lies between latitudes 30° and 42° N, and longitudes 32° and 6° W.
Mainland Portugal is split by its main river, the Tagus, that flows from
Spain and disgorges in the Tagus Estuary, in Lisbon, before escaping
into the Atlantic. The northern landscape is mountainous towards the
interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys, whereas the
south, including the Algarve and the Alentejo regions, is characterized
by rolling plains. [102]
Portugal's highest peak is the similarly named Mount Pico on the
island of Pico in the Azores. This ancient volcano, with a height of
2,351 m (7,713 ft) is an iconic symbol of the Azores, while the Serra
da Estrela on the mainland (the summit being 1,991 m (6,532 ft) above
sea level) is an important seasonal attraction for skiers and winter
sports enthusiasts.
The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the
Topography and administration
Atlantic Ocean: the Azores straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on a
tectonic triple junction, and Madeira along a range formed by in-plate
hotspot geology. Geologically, these islands were formed by volcanic and seismic events. The last terrestrial
volcanic eruption occurred in 1957–58 (Capelinhos) and minor earthquakes occur sporadically, usually of
low intensity.
Portugal's exclusive economic zone, a sea zone over which the Portuguese have special rights over the
exploration and use of marine resources, has 1,727,408 km 2 (666,956 sq mi). This is the 3rd largest
exclusive economic zone of the European Union and the 20th largest in the world. [103]
Climate
Portugal is mainly characterized by a Mediterranean climate (Csa in the South, central interior, and the
Douro river valley; Csb in the North, Central west and Vicentine Coast), [104] temperate maritime climate
(Cfb) in the mainland north-western highlands and mountains, and in some high altitude zones of the
Azorean islands; a semi-arid climate in certain parts of the Beja District far south (BSk) and in Porto Santo
Island (BSh), a warm desert climate (BWh) in the Selvagens Islands and a humid subtropical climate in the
western Azores (Cfa), according to the Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification. It is one of the warmest
countries in Europe: the annual average temperature in mainland Portugal varies from 10–12 °C (50.0–
53.6 °F) in the mountainous interior north to 16–18 °C (60.8–64.4 °F) in the south and on the Guadiana
river basin. There are however, variations from the highlands to the lowlands: Spanish biologist Salvador
Rivas Martinez presents several different bioclimatic zones for Portugal. [105] The Algarve, separated from
the Alentejo region by mountains reaching up to 900 metres (3,000 ft) in Alto da Fóia, has a climate similar
to that of the southern coastal areas of Spain or Southwest Australia.Annual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over
3,200 mm (126.0 in) on the Peneda-Gerês National Park to less than
500 mm (19.7 in) in southern parts of Alentejo. Mount Pico is
recognized as receiving the largest annual rainfall (over 6,250 mm
(246.1 in) per year) in Portugal, according to Instituto Português do
Mar e da Atmosfera.
In some areas, such as the Guadiana basin, annual diurnal average
temperatures can be as high as 26 °C (79 °F), and summer's highest
temperatures are routinely over 40 °C (104 °F). The record high of
47.4 °C (117.3 °F) was recorded in Amareleja, although this might not
be the hottest spot in summer, according to satellite readings. [106][107]
Snowfalls occur regularly in the
winter in the interior North and
Centre of the country in districts
such as Guarda, Bragança, Viseu
and Vila Real, particularly on the
mountains. In winter, temperatures
may drop below −10.0 °C
(14.0 °F), particularly in Serra da
Estrela, Serra do Gerês, Serra do
Marão and Serra de Montesinho.
In these places snow can fall any
time from October to May. In the
Köppen climate classification
South of the country snowfalls are
map of continental Portugal
rare but still occur in the highest
elevations. While the official
absolute minimum by IPMA is −16.0 °C (3.2 °F) in Penhas da Saúde
and Miranda do Douro, lower temperatures have been recorded, such
as −17.5 °C (0.5 °F) by Bragança Polytechnic Institute in the outskirts
of the city in 1983, and below −20.0 °C (−4.0 °F) in Serra da Estrela.
The Marinha Beach in Lagoa,
Algarve is considered by the
Michelin Guide as one of the 10
most beautiful beaches in Europe
and as one of the 100 most
beautiful beaches in the world.
Continental Portugal receives around 2,300 to 3,200 hours of sunshine
a year, an average of 4–6 hours in winter and 10–12 hours in the
summer, with higher values in the south-east, south-west and the
Algarve coast and lower in the north-west. Insolation values are lower
in the archipelagos, with around 1,600 hours in the humid Flores Island and around 2,300 hours in the
island of Madeira and Porto Santo. Insolation in the Selvagens is thought to be higher due to weaker
orographic lift and their relative proximity to the Sahara Desert.
Portugal's central west and southwest coasts have an extreme ocean seasonal lag, sea temperatures are
warmer in October than in July and are their coldest in March. The average sea surface temperature on the
west coast of mainland Portugal varies from 14–16 °C (57.2–60.8 °F) in January−March to 19–21 °C
(66.2–69.8 °F) in August−October while on the south coast it ranges from 16 °C (60.8 °F) in
January−March and rises in the summer to about 22–23 °C (71.6–73.4 °F), occasionally reaching 26 °C
(78.8 °F). [108] In the Azores, around 16 °C (60.8 °F) in February−April to 22–24 °C (71.6–75.2 °F) in
July−September, [109] and in Madeira, around 18 °C (64.4 °F) in February−April to 23–24 °C (73.4–
75.2 °F) in August−October. [110]Both the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate, although variations between
islands exist, making weather predictions very difficult (owing to rough topography). The Madeira and
Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range, with annual average temperatures exceeding
20 °C (68 °F) in some parts of the coast (according to the Portuguese Meteorological Institute). Some
islands in Azores do have drier months in the summer. Consequently, the islands of the Azores have been
identified as having a Mediterranean climate (both Csa and Csb types), while some islands (such as Flores
or Corvo) are classified as Humid subtropical (Cfa), transitioning into an Oceanic climate (Cfb) at higher
altitudes, according to Köppen-Geiger classification.
Porto Santo Island in Madeira has a warm semi-arid climate (BSh). The Savage Islands, which are part of
the regional territory of Madeira and a nature reserve are unique in being classified as a desert climate
(BWh) with an annual average rainfall of approximately 150 mm (5.9 in). The sea surface temperature in
these islands varies from 18.5 °C (65.3 °F) in winter to 23–24 °C (73.4–75.2 °F) in the summer
occasionally reaching 25 °C (77.0 °F).
Biodiversity
Portugal is located on the Mediterranean Basin, the third most diverse
hotspot of flora in the world. [111] Due to its geographical and climatic
context - between the Atlantic and Mediterranean - Portugal has a high
level of biodiversity on land and at sea. It is home to six terrestrial
ecoregions: Azores temperate mixed forests, Cantabrian mixed forests,
Madeira evergreen forests, Iberian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous
forests, Northwest Iberian montane forests, and Southwest Iberian
Mediterranean sclerophyllous and mixed forests. [112] Over 22% of its
land area is included in the Natura 2000 network, including 62 special
conservation areas and 88 types of protected landscape natural
habitats. [113][111]
Peneda-Gerês National Park is
the only nationally designated
park in Portugal, owing to the
rarity and significance of its
environment.
Eucalyptus (non-native, commercial plantations), cork oak and
maritime pine together make up 71% of the total forested area of
continental Portugal, followed by the holm oak, the stone pine, the
other oak trees (Q. robur, Q. faginea and Q. pyrenaica) and the sweet
chestnut, respectively. [114] In Madeira, laurisilva (recognized as a
World Heritage Site) dominates the landscape, especially on the northern slope. The predominant species in
this forest include Laurus novocanariensis, Apollonias barbujana, Ocotea foetens and Persea indica.
Before human occupation the Azores were also rich in dense laurisilva forests, today these native forests are
undermined by the introduced Pittosporum undulatum and Cryptomeria japonica. [115][116] There have
been several projects aimed to recover the Laurisilva present in the Azores. [117] Remnants of these
laurisilva forests are also present in continental Portugal with its few living testimonies Laurus nobilis,
Prunus lusitanica, Arbutus unedo, Myrica faya and Rhododendron ponticum. [118]
These geographical and climatic conditions facilitate the introduction of exotic species that later turn to be
invasive and destructive to the native habitats. Around 20% of the total number of extant species in
continental Portugal are exotic. [119] In Madeira, around 36% [120] and in the Azores, around 70% species
are exotic. [121][122] Due to this, Portugal was placed 168th globally out of 172 countries on the Forest
Landscape Integrity Index in 2019. [123]
Portugal is the second country in Europe with the highest number of threatened animal and plant species
(488 as of 2020). [124][125]Chameleo from Algarve

Portugal as a whole is an important stopover for migratory bird
species: the southern marshes of the eastern Algarve (Ria Formosa,
Castro Marim) and the Lisbon Region (Tagus Estuary, Sado
Estuary) hosting various aquatic bird species, the Bonelli's eagle
and Egyptian vulture on the northern valleys of the Douro
International, the black stork and griffon vulture on the Tagus
International, the seabird sanctuaries of the Savage Islands and
Berlengas and the highlands of Madeira and São Miguel all
represent the great diversity of wild avian species (around 450 in
continental Portugal), not only migratory but also endemic (e.g.
trocaz pigeon, Azores bullfinch) or exotic (crested myna, pin-tailed
The large mammalian species of Portugal (the fallow deer, red deer, roe deer, Iberian ibex, wild boar, red
fox, Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx) were once widespread throughout the country, but intense hunting,
habitat degradation and growing pressure from agriculture and livestock reduced population numbers on a
large scale in the 19th and early 20th century, others, such as the Portuguese ibex were even led to
extinction. Today, these animals are re-expanding their native range. [128][129] Smaller mammals include the
red squirrel, European badger, Eurasian otter, Egyptian mongoose, Granada hare, European rabbit,
common genet, European wildcat, among others. [129]
Due to their isolated location, the volcanic islands of the Azores, Madeira and Salvages, part of
Macaronesia, have many endemic species that have evolved independently from their European, African
and occasionally American relatives.
The Portuguese west coast is part of the four major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems of the ocean.
This seasonal upwelling system typically seen during the summer months brings cooler, nutrient rich water
up to the sea surface promoting phytoplankton growth, zooplankton development and the subsequent rich
diversity in pelagic fish and other marine invertebrates. [130]
This, adding to its large EEZ makes Portugal
one of the largest per capita fish-consumers in
the world. [131] Sardines (Sardina pilchardus)
and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) are
collected in the thousands every year. [132]
while blue whiting, monkfish, Atlantic cod,
cephalopods, skates or any other form of
seafood are traditionally fished in the local
coastal villages. [133] This upwelling also
allows Portugal to have kelp forests which are
otherwise very uncommon or non-existent on
the Mediterranean. [134]
73% of the freshwater fish occurring in the
Iberian Peninsula are endemic, the largest out
Exclusive economic zone of Portugal
of any region in Europe. [135] Many of these
endemic species are concentrated in bodies of
water of the central western region (one
exclusively endemic), these and other bodies of water throughout the Peninsula are mostly temporary and
prone to drought every year, placing most of these species under Threatened status. [136]Around 24 [137] to 28 [138] species of cetacean roam through the Azores, making it one of four places in the
world where most species of this infraorder occur. [137] Starting in the mid-19th century and ceasing in
1984, whaling (especially of sperm whale) heavily exploited this diversity. Beginning in the early 90s,
whale watching quickly grew to popularity and is now one of the main economic activities in the
Portuguese archipelago. [139][140]
Some protected areas in Portugal other than the ones previously mentioned include: the Serras de Aire e
Candeeiros with its limestone formations, paleontological history and great diversity in bats and
orchids, [141] the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park with its well preserved, wild
coastline. [142] the Montesinho Natural Park which hosts some of the only populations of Iberian wolf and
recent sightings of Iberian brown bear, [143] which had been considered extinct in the country; among other
species.
Government and politics
Portugal has been a semi-presidential representative
democratic republic since the ratification of the
Constitution of 1976, with Lisbon, the nation's largest
city, as its capital. [144] The Constitution grants the
division or separation of powers among four bodies
referred as "organs of Sovereignty": the President of the
Republic, the Government, the Assembly of the
Republic and the Courts. [145]
The President, who is elected to a five-year term, has an
executive role: the current President is Marcelo Rebelo
Marcelo Rebelo de
António Costa
de Sousa. The Assembly of the Republic is a single
Sousa
Prime Minister of Portugal
chamber parliament composed of a maximum of 230
President of Portugal
since 2015
deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is
since 2016
headed by the Prime Minister (currently António Costa)
and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State. The
Courts are organized into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The
Supreme Courts are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member Constitutional Court oversees the
constitutionality of the laws.
Portugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the
national, regional and local levels. The Assembly of the Republic, Regional Assemblies and local
municipalities and parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the Socialist Party and the Social
Democratic Party, in addition to the Unitary Democratic Coalition (Portuguese Communist Party and
Ecologist Party "The Greens"), the Left Bloc and the Democratic and Social Centre – People's Party,
which garner between 5 and 15% of the vote regularly.
Presidency of the Republic
The Head of State of Portugal is the President of the Republic, elected to a five-year term by direct,
universal suffrage. Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and the other
members of the Government (where the President takes into account the results of legislative elections);
dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly of the Republic (to call early elections); vetoing
legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring a state of war or siege. The President
has also supervisory and reserve powers and is the ex officio Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.The President is advised on issues of importance by the Council of
State, which is composed of six senior civilian officers, any former
Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution, five members
chosen by the Assembly, and five selected by the president.
Government
The Government is headed by the presidentially appointed Prime
Minister, also including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers,
Ministers, Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State.
Belém Palace serves as the official
residence and workplace of the
President of the Republic.
The Government is both the organ of sovereignty that conducts the
general politics of the country and the superior body of the public
administration.
It has essentially Executive powers, but has also limited legislative
powers. The Government can legislate about its own organization,
about areas covered by legislative authorizations conceded by the
Assembly of the Republic and about the specific regulation of
generalist laws issued by the Assembly.
The Praça do Comércio houses
multiple ministries of the
Government of Portugal.
The Council of Ministers – under the presidency of the Prime
Minister (or the President of Portugal at the latter's request) and the Ministers (may also include one or more
Deputy Prime Ministers) – acts as the cabinet. Each government is required to define the broad outline of its
policies in a programme, and present it to the Assembly for a mandatory period of debate. The failure of the
Assembly to reject the government programme by an absolute majority of deputies confirms the cabinet in
office.
Parliament
The Assembly of the Republic, in Lisbon, is the national parliament
of Portugal. It is the main legislative body, although the
Government also has limited legislative powers.
The Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of
up to 230 deputies. Elected by universal suffrage according to a
system of closed party-list proportional representation, deputies
serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the
Assembly and calls for new elections.
Currently the Government (PS) has an absolute majority of seats in
Parliament. The PSD is the main opposition party, alongside
Chega, Liberal Initiative, BE, PCP, PAN and Livre.
The Assembly of the Republic is
housed in São Bento Palace in
Lisbon.
Foreign relations
A member state of the United Nations since 1955, Portugal is also a founding member of NATO (1949),
OECD (1961) and EFTA (1960); it left the last in 1986 to join the European Economic Community, which
became the European Union in 1993.In 1996, Portugal co-founded the Community of Portuguese
Language Countries (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone
Commonwealth, an international organization and political
association of Lusophone nations across four continents, where
Portuguese is an official language. The global headquarters of the
CPLP is in Penafiel Palace, in Lisbon.
António Guterres, who has served as Prime Minister of Portugal
from 1995 to 2002 and UN High Commissioner for Refugees from
2005 to 2015, assumed the post of UN Secretary-General on 1
January 2017; making him the first Secretary-General from Western
Europe since Kurt Waldheim of Austria (1972–1981), the first
former head of government to become Secretary-General and the
first Secretary-General born after the establishment of the United
Nations on 26 June 1945.
In addition, Portugal was a full member of the Latin Union (1983)
and the Organization of Ibero-American States (1949). It has a
friendship alliance and dual citizenship treaty with its former
colony, Brazil. Portugal and the United Kingdom share the world's
oldest active military accord through their Anglo-Portuguese
Alliance (Treaty of Windsor), which was signed in 1373.
There are two international territorial disputes, both with Spain:

Olivenza. Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the
municipality of Olivenza was ceded to Spain under the
Treaty of Badajoz in 1801, after the War of the Oranges. Portugal claimed it back in 1815
under the Treaty of Vienna. However, since the 19th century, it has been continuously ruled
by Spain which considers the territory theirs not only de facto but also de jure. [146]
The Ilhas Selvagens (Savage Islands). The archipelago is under Portuguese domination but
is geographically closer to the Canary Islands (165 km) than to Madeira (280 km). Found in
1364 by Italian navigators, the islands belonged to private owners until 1971, when the
Portuguese government bought them and established a natural reserve area covering the
whole archipelago. The islands have been claimed by Spain since 1911 and the dispute
has caused some periods of political tension between the two countries. The main problem
is not so much their intrinsic value but the fact that they expand the Exclusive Economic
Zone of Portugal considerably to the south. [147]
Military
The armed forces have three branches: Navy, Army and Air Force.
They serve primarily as a self-defence force whose mission is to
protect the territorial integrity of the country and provide
humanitarian assistance and security at home and abroad. As of
2008, the three branches numbered 39,200 active personnel
including 7,500 women. Portuguese military expenditure in 2009
was 5 billion US$, [148] representing 2.1 per cent of GDP. Military
conscription was abolished in 2004. The minimum age for
voluntary recruitment is 18 years.
Portuguese Army - Leopard 2A6The Army (21,000 personnel) comprises three brigades and other
small units. An infantry brigade (mainly equipped with Pandur II
APC), a mechanized brigade (mainly equipped with Leopard 2 A6
tanks and M113 APC) and a Rapid Reaction Brigade (consisting of
paratroopers, commandos and rangers). The Navy (10,700
personnel, of which 1,580 are marines), the world's oldest surviving
naval force, has five frigates, seven corvettes, two submarines, and
28 patrol and auxiliary vessels. The Air Force (7,500 personnel)
has the Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon as the main combat aircraft.
Portuguese Navy - MEKO-200 PN
In addition to the three branches of the armed forces, there is the
National Republican Guard, a security force subject to military law
and organization (gendarmerie) comprising 25,000 personnel. This
force is under the authority of both the Defence and the Interior
Ministry. It has provided detachments for participation in
international operations in Iraq and East Timor.
The United States maintains a military presence with 770 troops in
the Lajes Air Base at Terceira Island, in the Azores. The Allied
Joint Force Command Lisbon (JFC Lisbon) – one of the three main
subdivisions of NATO's Allied Command Operations – it is based
in Oeiras, near Lisbon.

In the 20th century, Portugal engaged in two major conflicts: World War I and the Portuguese Colonial War
(1961–1974). After the end of the Portuguese Empire in 1975, the Portuguese Armed Forces have
participated in peacekeeping missions in East Timor, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq
(Nasiriyah), Lebanon, Mali [149] and Central African Republic. [150] Portugal also conducted several
independent unilateral military operations abroad, as were the cases of the interventions of the Portuguese
Armed Forces in Angola in 1992 and in Guinea-Bissau in 1998 with the main objectives of protecting and
withdrawing of Portuguese and foreign citizens threatened by local civil conflicts.
Law
The Portuguese legal system is part of the civil law legal system,
also called the continental family legal system. The main laws
include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the Portuguese Civil
Code (1966, as amended) and the Penal Code of Portugal (1982, as
amended). Other relevant laws are the Commercial Code (1888, as
amended) and the Civil Procedure Code (1961, as amended).
The supreme national courts are the Supreme Court of Justice and
the Constitutional Court. The Public Ministry, headed by the
Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body
of public prosecutors.
Lisbon's Campus of Justice
Portuguese laws were applied in the former colonies and territories and continue to be major influences for
those countries.
Portugal was the first country in the world to abolish life imprisonment (in 1884) and was one of the first
countries to abolish the death penalty. Maximum prison sentences are limited to 25 years.Portugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country
in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other
developed nations including cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and LSD. While possession is legal, trafficking and
possession of more than "10 days worth of personal use" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People
caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse
treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug
consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of HIV
infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined,
however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group. [151][152][153]
LGBTI rights have increased substantially in the past years. On 27 August 2003, Portugal added the anti-
discrimination employment law on the basis of sexual orientation. [154] At 24 July 2004, sexual orientation
was added to the Constitution as part of the protected from discrimination characteristics. [155] On 31 May
2010, Portugal became the sixth country in Europe and the eighth country in the world to legally recognize
same-sex marriage at the national level. The law came into force on 5 June 2010. [156] Same-sex adoption
has been allowed since 1 March 2016 [157] as is female same-sex couple access to medically assisted
reproduction since 13 May 2016. [158] This bill was adopted by the Parliament and signed by President
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. [159][160][161] As of January 2017 the New Law of Gender Identity, [162]
simplified the legal process of gender and name change for transgender people, making it easier for minors
to change their sex marker in legal documents. [163] At August 2018, the right to gender identity and gender
expression self-determination became protected, intersex minors became protected by law from unnecessary
medical procedures "until the minor gender identity manifests" and the right of protection from
discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics also became protected by the same law. [164]
Law enforcement
Portugal's main police organizations are the Guarda Nacional
Republicana – GNR (National Republican Guard), a gendarmerie; the
Polícia de Segurança Pública – PSP (Public Security Police), a
civilian police force who work in urban areas; and the Polícia
Judiciária – PJ (Judicial Police), a highly specialized criminal
investigation police that is overseen by the Public Ministry.
Correctional services
Portugal has 49 correctional facilities in total run by the Ministry of
Justice. They include seventeen central prisons, four special prisons,
twenty-seven regional prisons, and one 'Cadeia de Apoio' (Support
Detention Centre). [165] As of 1 January 2021, their current prison
population is about 11,234 inmates, which comes to about 0.11% of
their entire population. [166] Their incarceration rate has been on the
rise since 2010, with a 15% increase over the past eight years. [166]

Administrative divisions
Administratively, Portugal is divided into 308 municipalities (Portuguese: municípios or concelhos), which
after a reform in 2013 are subdivided into 3,092 civil parishes (Portuguese: freguesia). Operationally, the
municipality and civil parish, along with the national government, are the only legally local administrative
units identified by the government of Portugal (for example, cities, towns or villages have no standing inlaw, although may be used as catchment for the defining services). For statistical purposes the Portuguese
government also identifies Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), inter-municipal
communities and informally, the district system, used until European integration (and being phased-out by
the national government). Continental Portugal is agglomerated into 18 districts, while the archipelagos of
the Azores and Madeira are governed as autonomous regions; the largest units, established since 1976, are
either mainland Portugal (Portuguese: Portugal Continental) and the autonomous regions of Portugal
(Azores and Madeira).
The 18 districts of mainland Portugal are: Aveiro, Beja, Braga, Bragança, Castelo Branco, Coimbra, Évora,
Faro, Guarda, Leiria, Lisbon, Portalegre, Porto, Santarém, Setúbal, Viana do Castelo, Vila Real and
Viseu – each district takes the name of the district capital.
Within the European Union NUTS system, Portugal is divided into seven regions: the Azores, Alentejo,
Algarve, Centro, Lisboa, Madeira and Norte, and with the exception of the Azores and Madeira, NUTS
areas are subdivided into 28 subregions.

billion-euro bailout from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund in May 2011. [168] The ratio of Portugal's debt to its
overall economy, was 107 per cent when it received the
bailout. [168] As part of the deal, the country agreed to cut its budget
deficit from 9.8 per cent of GDP in 2010 to 5.9 per cent in 2011,
4.5 per cent in 2012 and 3 per cent in 2013. [169]
After the bailout was announced, the Portuguese government
headed by Pedro Passos Coelho managed to implement measures
with the intention of improving the state's financial situation,

spending cuts. The Portuguese government also agreed to eliminate
its golden share in Portugal Telecom which gave it veto power over
vital decisions. [170][171] In 2012, all public servants had already
seen an average wage cut of 20% relative to their 2010 baseline, with cuts reaching 25% for those earning
more than 1,500 euro per month. [172]
The IMF, the European Commission (EC) and the European Central Bank (ECB) said in September 2012
that Portugal's debt would peak at 124 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014. [173] The IMF previously
said in July 2012 that Portugal's debt would peak at about 118.5 per cent of GDP in 2013. [173] In
September 2013, the Portuguese Government reviewed again the public debt of Portugal for 2013 to 127.8
per cent, after a peak of 130.9 per cent in that month. [174]
A report released in January 2011 by the Diário de Notícias [175] and published in Portugal by Gradiva, had
demonstrated that in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic
Portuguese Republic governments encouraged over-expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear
Public–private partnerships and funding of numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and
advisory of committees and firms. This allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works and
inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies
boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European
structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades. [176]
Two Portuguese banks, Banco Português de Negócios (BPN) and Banco Privado Português (BPP), had
been accumulating losses for years due to bad investments, embezzlement and accounting fraud. The case
of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications – Portugal's
then President, Cavaco Silva and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships
with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other
crimes. [177][178][179] On grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the Portuguese
economy, the Portuguese government decided to give them a bailout, eventually at a future loss to taxpayers
and to the Portuguese people in general.
EconomyPortugal is a developed and a high-income country, with a
GDP per capita of 74% of the EU27 average in 2021 (a
decrease from 76% in 2012) [180] and a HDI of 0.864 (the
38th highest) in 2020. [181] By the end of 2021, Portugal's
GDP (PPP) was $36,381 per capita, according to OECD's
report. [182] The national currency of Portugal is the euro (€),
which replaced the Portuguese Escudo in 2002, and the
country was one of the original member states of the
eurozone. Portugal's central bank is the Banco de Portugal,
an integral part of the European System of Central Banks.

Since the Carnation Revolution of 1974, which culminated in the
end of one of Portugal's most notable phases of economic
expansion (that started in the 1960s), [185] a significant change has
occurred in the nation's annual economic growth. [186] After the
turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the PREC period, Portugal tried
to adapt to a changing modern global economy, a process that
continues in 2013. Since the 1990s, Portugal's public consumption-
based economic development model has been slowly changing to a
system that is focused on exports, private investment and the
development of the high-tech sector. Consequently, business
services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles,
clothing, footwear and cork (Portugal is the world's leading cork
producer), [187] wood products and beverages. [188]

The bailout, agreed to in 2011, required Portugal to enter into a
range of austerity measures in exchange for funding support of
€78,000,000,000. In May 2014, the country exited the bailout but reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining
its reformist momentum. At the time of exiting the bailout, the economy had contracted by 0.7% in the first
quarter of 2014; however, unemployment, while still high, had fallen to 15.3%. [189]
The average salary in Portugal is €1,039 per month, excluding self-
employed individuals [190] and the minimum wage, which is
regulated by law, is €705 per month (paid 14 times per annum) as
of 2022. [191][192][193]

The Global Competitiveness Report for 2019, published by the
World Economic Forum, placed Portugal on the 34th position on
the economic index.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life index placed
Portugal as the country with the 19th-best quality of life in the
world for 2005, ahead of other economically and technologicallyadvanced countries like France, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Korea, but nine places behind its
sole neighbour, Spain. [194] This is despite the fact that Portugal remains as one of the countries with the
lowest per capita GDP in Western Europe. [195]
Major state-owned companies include: Águas de
Portugal (water), Caixa Geral de Depósitos (banking),
Comboios de Portugal (railways), Companhia das
Lezírias (agriculture) and RTP (media). Some former
state-owned entities are managed by state-run holding
company Parpública, which is a shareholder of several
public and private companies. Among former state-
owned companies recently privatized are: CTT (postal
service) and ANA (airports).

The International Monetary Fund issued an update report on the economy of Portugal in late-June 2017
with a strong near-term outlook and an increase in investments and exports over previous years. Because of
a surplus in 2016, the country was no longer bound by the Excessive Deficit Procedure which had been
implemented during an earlier financial crisis. The banking system was more stable, although there were
still non-performing loans and corporate debt. The IMF recommended working on solving these problems
for Portugal to be able to attract more private investment. "Sustained strong growth, together with continued
public debt reduction, would reduce vulnerabilities arising from high indebtedness, particularly when
monetary accommodation is reduced." The OECD economic reports since 2018 show recovery, albeit
slow; and Portugal's growth prospects continue positive for 2020. [196][197][198]
Primary sector
Agriculture in Portugal is based on small to medium-
sized family-owned dispersed units. However, the sector
also includes larger scale intensive farming export-

products, including: tomatoes, citrus, green vegetables,
rice, wheat, barley, maize, olives, oilseeds, nuts,
cherries, bilberry, table grapes, edible mushrooms, dairy
products, poultry and beef. According to FAO, Portugal is the top producer of cork and carob in the world,
accounting to about 50% and 30% of world production, respectively. [199] It is also the third largest exporter
of chestnuts and the third largest European producer of pulp. [200] Portugal is among the top ten largest olive
oil producers in the world and is the fourth largest exporter. [201] The country is also one of the world's
largest exporters of wine, being reputed for its fine wines.Forestry has also played an important economic role among the rural communities and industry (namely
paper industry that includes Portucel Soporcel Group, engineered wood that includes Sonae Indústria, and
furniture that includes several manufacturing plants in and around Paços de Ferreira, the core of Portugal's
major industrial operations of IKEA). In 2001, the gross agricultural product accounted for 4% of the
national GDP.
Traditionally a sea power, Portugal has had a strong tradition in the
Portuguese fishing sector and is one of the countries with the
highest fish consumption per capita. [202] The main landing sites in
Portugal (including Azores and Madeira), according to total
landings in weight by year, are the harbours of Matosinhos,
Peniche, Olhão, Sesimbra, Figueira da Foz, Sines, Portimão and
Madeira. Portuguese-processed fish products are exported through
several companies, under a number of different brands and
registered trademarks, such as Ramirez, the world's oldest active
canned fish producer.

Portugal is a significant European minerals producer and is ranked
among Europe's leading copper producers. The nation is also a
notable producer of tin, tungsten and uranium. However, the
country lacks the potential to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and
aluminium, a limitation that has hindered the development of
Portugal's mining and metallurgy sectors. Although the country has vast iron and coal reserves – mainly in
the north – after the 1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization, low competitiveness
forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals. The Panasqueira and Neves-Corvo mines are
among the most recognized Portuguese mines that are still in operation. [203]
Portugal is rich in its lithium subsoil, which is especially concentrated in the districts of Guarda, Viseu, Vila
Real and Viana do Castelo, while most of the country's lithium comes from the Gonçalo aplite-pegmatite
field. The largest lithium mine in Europe is operated by Grupo Mota, Felmica, in the Guarda region, which
is estimated to have reserves for 30 years of production. It has five more deposits in its
possession. [204][205][206] Savannah Resources in May 2018 announced a 52% increase in the estimated
lithium resources at the Mina do Barroso Lithium Project in northern Portugal, saying the country could
become the first European supplier of spodumene, a lithium-bearing mineral. [207] The company said the
estimated mineral resources at the mine now stood at 14 million tonnes. Lithium prices have risen in
expectation of growing demand for the mineral, which is used in batteries for electric vehicles and for
storing electricity from the power grid. Europe consumes more than 20 per cent of the global supply of
battery-grade lithium but currently has to import all its supplies of the mineral. [208]
W Resources stated in 2018 that it had started a new drilling campaign at its São Martinho gold project in
Portugal. The so-called reverse circulation drilling programme included 15 holes with around 2,000 metres
(6,600 ft) of total drilling. The objective is to extend resources by integrating the data from 2016 drilling
results with the expansion expected with the ongoing campaign. [209][210][211]
Secondary sector
Industry is diversified, ranging from automotive (Volkswagen Autoeuropa and Peugeot Citroën) and
bicycles, [212] aerospace (Embraer and OGMA), electronics and textiles, to food, chemicals, cement and
wood pulp. Volkswagen Group's AutoEuropa motor vehicle assembly plant in Palmela is among the largest
foreign direct investment projects in Portugal. Modern non-traditional technology-based industries, such as
aerospace, biotechnology and information technology, have been developed in several locations across thecountry. Alverca, Évora [213] and Ponte de Sor are the
main centres of the Portuguese aerospace industry,
which is led by Brazil-based company Embraer and the
Portuguese company OGMA. Following the turn of the
21st century, many major biotechnology and information
technology industries have been founded, and are
concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Lisbon, Porto,
Braga, Coimbra and Aveiro.

The banking and insurance sectors performed well until the
financial crisis of 2007–2008, and this partly reflected a rapid
deepening of the market in Portugal. While sensitive to various
types of market and underwriting risks, it has been estimated that
overall both the life and non-life sectors will be able to withstand a
number of severe shocks, even though the impact on individual
insurers varies widely. [214]

Travel and tourism continue to be extremely important for Portugal.
It has been necessary for the country to focus upon its niche
attractions, such as health, nature and rural tourism, to stay ahead of its competitors. [215]
Portugal is among the top 20 most-visited countries in the world, receiving an average of 20,000,000
foreign tourists each year. [216] In 2014, Portugal was elected The Best European Country by USA
Today. [217]
In 2017, Portugal was elected both Europe's Leading Destination [218] and in 2018 and 2019, World's

Tourist hotspots in Portugal are: Lisbon, Cascais, Fatima, Algarve,
Madeira, Porto and Coimbra. Lisbon attracts the sixteenth-most tourists
among European cities [220] (with seven million tourists occupying the
city's hotels in 2006). [221] Notable luxury destinations include the
Portuguese Riviera and the Comporta Coast.
Also, between 5–6 million religious pilgrims visit Fatima each year,
where apparitions of the Virgin Mary to three shepherd children
allegedly took place in 1917. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima is
one of the largest Roman Catholic shrines in the world. The
Portuguese government continues to promote and develop new tourist
destinations, such as the Douro Valley, the island of Porto Santo, and
Alentejo.
Rooster of Barcelos, an iconic
Portuguese souvenir
The legend of the Rooster of Barcelos tells the story of a dead rooster's
miraculous intervention in proving the innocence of a man who had
been falsely accused and sentenced to death. The story is associated with the 17th-century calvary that is
part of the collection of the Archaeological Museum located in Paço dos Condes, a gothic-style palace in
Barcelos, a city in northwest Portugal. The Rooster of Barcelos is bought by thousands of tourists as a
national souvenir.On 30 November 2016, the United Nations added the Portuguese Bisalhães tradition of making black
pottery to the UNESCO Heritage Protection List. [222] On 7 December 2017, the United Nations added the
Bonecos de Estremoz – Toys of Estremoz tradition as an UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of
Humankind. [223]
Quaternary sector
Scientific and technological research activities in Portugal are mainly conducted within a network of R&D
units belonging to public universities and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the INETI –
Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inovação and the INRB – Instituto Nacional dos Recursos
Biológicos. The funding and management of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority
of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education (MCTES) and the MCTES's Fundação para
a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT).
The largest R&D units of the public universities by volume of
research grants and peer-reviewed publications, include biosciences
research institutions like the Instituto de Medicina Molecular, the
Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, the IPATIMUP, the
Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular and the Abel Salazar
Biomedical Sciences Institute.

multinational high-tech and industrial companies, are also
responsible for research and development projects. One of the
oldest learned societies of Portugal is the Sciences Academy of Lisbon, founded in 1779.
Iberian bilateral state-supported research efforts include the International Iberian Nanotechnology
Laboratory and the Ibercivis distributed computing platform, which are joint research programmes of both
Portugal and Spain. Portugal is a member of several pan-European scientific organizations. These include
the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), ITER, and the
European Southern Observatory (ESO).
Portugal has the largest aquarium in Europe, the Lisbon Oceanarium, and the Portuguese have several other
notable organizations focused on science-related exhibits and divulgation, like the state agency Ciência
Viva, a programme of the Portuguese Ministry of Science and Technology to the promotion of a scientific
and technological culture among the Portuguese population, [224] the Science Museum of the University of
Coimbra, the National Museum of Natural History at the University of Lisbon, and the Visionarium. With
the emergence and growth of several science parks throughout the world that helped create many thousands
of scientific, technological and knowledge-based businesses, Portugal started to develop several [225]
science parks across the country. These include the Taguspark (in Oeiras), the Coimbra iParque (in
Coimbra), the biocant (in Cantanhede), the Madeira Tecnopolo [226] (in Funchal), Sines Tecnopolo [227] (in
Sines), Tecmaia [228] (in Maia) and Parkurbis [229] (in Covilhã). Companies locate in the Portuguese science
parks to take advantage of a variety of services ranging from financial and legal advice through to
marketing and technological support.

impressive increase in innovation expenditure and output. [230] Portugal was ranked 31st in the Global
Innovation Index in 2021, up from 32nd in 2019. [231][232][233][234]
Transport
By the early-1970s, Portugal's fast economic growth with increasing consumption and purchase of new
automobiles set the priority for improvements in transportation. Again in the 1990s, after joining the
European Economic Community, the country built many new motorways. Today, the country has a
68,732 km (42,708 mi) road network, of which almost 3,000 km (1,864 mi) are part of system of 44
motorways. Opened in 1944, the first motorway (which linked Lisbon to the National Stadium) was an
innovative project that made Portugal one of the first countries in the world to establish a motorway (this
roadway eventually became the Lisbon-Cascais highway, or A5).
Although a few other tracts were created (around 1960 and 1970),
it was only after the beginning of the 1980s that large-scale
motorway construction was implemented. In 1972, Brisa, the
highway concessionaire, was founded to handle the management of
many of the region's motorways. On many highways, a toll needs
to be paid (see Via Verde). Vasco da Gama bridge is the longest
bridge in the EU (the second longest in Europe) at
12.345 km. [235][236]

serviced by four international airports located near the principal
cities of Lisbon, Porto, Faro and Beja. Lisbon's geographical
position makes it a stopover for many foreign airlines at several airports within the country. The primary
flag-carrier is TAP Air Portugal, although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without
the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in Alcochete, to replace Lisbon
Portela Airport, though this plan has been suspended due to austerity measures. Currently, the most
important airports are in Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Funchal (Madeira), and Ponta Delgada (Azores), managed by
the national airport authority group ANA – Aeroportos de Portugal. One other important airport is the
Aeroporto Internacional das Lajes on the island of Terceira in the Azores. This airport serves as one of two
international airports serving countries outside the European Union for all nine islands of the Azores. It also
serves as a military air base for the United States Air Force. The base remains in use to the present day.
A national railway system that extends throughout the country and into Spain, is supported and
administered by Comboios de Portugal (CP). Rail transport of passengers and goods is derived using the
2,791 km (1,734 mi) of railway lines currently in service, of which 1,430 km (889 mi) are electrified and
about 900 km (559 mi) allow train speeds greater than 120 km/h (75 mph). The railway network is
managed by Infraestruturas de Portugal while the transport of passengers and goods are the responsibility of
CP, both public companies. In 2006, the CP carried 133,000,000 passengers and 9,750,000 tonnes
(9,600,000 long tons; 10,700,000 short tons) of goods.
The major seaports are located in Sines, Lisbon, Leixões, Setúbal, Aveiro, Figueira da Foz, and Faro.
The two largest metropolitan areas have subway systems: Lisbon Metro and Metro Sul do Tejo in the
Lisbon metropolitan area and Porto Metro in the Porto Metropolitan Area, each with more than 35 km
(22 mi) of lines. In Portugal, Lisbon tram services have been supplied by the Companhia de Carris de
Ferro de Lisboa (Carris), for over a century. In Porto, a tram network, of which only a tourist line on the
shores of the Douro remains, began construction on 12 September 1895 (a first for the Iberian Peninsula).
All major cities and towns have their own local urban transport network, as well as taxi services.Energy
Portugal has considerable resources of wind and river power,
the two most cost-effective renewable energy sources. Since
the turn of the 21st century, there has been a trend towards
the development of a renewable resource industry and
reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuels. In
2006, the world's largest solar power plant at that date, the
Moura Photovoltaic Power Station, began operating near
Moura, in the south, while the world's first commercial wave
power farm, the Aguçadoura Wave Farm, opened in the
Norte region (2008). By the end of 2006, 66% of the
country's electrical production was from coal and fuel power
plants, while 29% were derived from hydroelectric dams, and
6% by wind energy. [237]
Portugal electricity production 1980–2019
In 2008, renewable energy resources were producing 43% of
the nation's consumption of electricity, even as hydroelectric production decreased with severe
droughts. [238] As of June 2010, electricity exports had outnumbered imports. In the period between January
and May 2010, 70% of the national production of energy came from renewable sources. [239]
Portugal's national energy transmission company, Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN), uses sophisticated
modelling to predict weather, especially wind patterns, and computer programs to calculate energy from the
various renewable-energy plants. Before the solar/wind revolution, Portugal had generated electricity from
hydropower plants on its rivers for decades. New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven
turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day,
generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-
way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like
rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium
price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.
Demographics
The Statistics Portugal (Portuguese: INE – Instituto Nacional de Estatística) estimates that, according to the
2021 census, the population was 10,344,802 (of which 52% was female and 48% was male). [9] The
median life expectancy in 2022 was 82.47 years. [240] This population has been relatively homogeneous for
most of its history: a single religion (Roman Catholicism) and a single language have contributed to this
ethnic and national unity. [241]
The most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one; current
interpretation of Y-chromosome and mtDNA data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in
Paleolithic peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago. All subsequent
migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese
is still Paleolithic. Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other
European populations. [242] Portuguese people have a preponderancy of genetics (Iron Age Period) [243]
which belong to R1b haplogroup family along with Brythonic, Alpine and Goidelic genetical markers.
Also expectable but not so common are South European (Sardinian, Italian and Balkans), broadly North-
western (West Germanic) and to a lesser extent British/Irish (Brythonic/Gaelic) and French (Alpine). With a
low confidence range there are Scandinavian and East European genetical markers. [243] Other sources
would point out a small presence of Berber and Jewish that would be also part of a low confidence
region. [244]Young people in traditional attire

Native Portuguese are an Iberian ethnic group and they form 95% of
the whole population, whose ancestry is very similar to Spaniards and
have strong ties with fellow Atlantic Arc countries like Ireland, British
Isles, France and Belgium due to maritime trade dated as far back as
the Bronze Age. These maritime contacts and the prevalence of R1b
haplogroup as the main genetical marker of these countries suggest a
common ancestry and cultural proximity. Other maritime contacts with
the Mediterranean especially with Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans and
Moors added some phenotypes in southern Portugal and particularly
southern Spain (the Tartessos culture), making Portugal and north-
western Spain a bridge between north-western Europe and the
Mediterranean but maintaining the Atlantic character.
Despite good economic development in the past three decades, the
Portuguese have been the shortest in Europe since 1890. This
emerging height gap took place in the 1840s and has increased since.
One of the driving factors was the modest real wage development,
given the late industrialization and economic growth in Portugal
compared to the European core. Another determinant was the delayed
human capital formation. [245]

The total fertility rate (TFR) as of 2015 was estimated at 1.52 children
born/woman, one of the lowest in the world, which is below the
replacement rate of 2.1, [246] it remains considerably below the high of
5.02 children born per woman in 1911. [247] In 2016, 52.8% of births
were to unmarried women. [248] Like most Western countries, Portugal
has to deal with low fertility levels: the country has experienced a sub-replacement fertility rate since the
1980s. [249] Portugal subsequently has the 17th oldest population in the world, with the average age of 43.7
years. [250]
The structure of Portuguese society is characterized by a significant inequality which in 2016 placed the
country in the lowest seventh of the Social Justice Index for the European Union. [251]
In 2018, Portugal's parliament approved a budget plan for 2019 that includes tax breaks for returning
emigrants in a bid to lure back those who left during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. The expansionary
2019 budget, backed by a left-wing majority in parliament, also aims to boost the purchasing power of
households while cutting the already low deficit even further. Returning emigrants will be allowed to
declare only half their taxable income for five years if they return, provided they have lived abroad for at
least three years. The "Return Programme" is to run for two years. Around 500,000 residents left Portugal
between 2010 and 2015 after the Great Recession. Although some 350,000 have since returned, this
scheme aims to encourage more to return – a similar scheme exists in Ireland. [252] Portugal has approved a
credit line for Portuguese emigrants aiming to invest in the country on their return. Furthermore, emigrants
returning in 2019 and 2020 will see their taxes halved as part of the stimulus to bring native Portuguese
back and revitalize the population and promote continued economic growth [253] – as Portugal struggles
with a low birth rate and an ageing population. According to projections by the national statistics office,
Portugal's population will fall to 7.7 million by 2080 from 10.3 million now and the population will
continue to age. [254]
UrbanizationSince the 2013 local government reform, there are two metropolitan areas: Lisbon and Porto. [255][256]
Several metropolitan areas were created under this law (Algarve, Aveiro, Coimbra, Minho and Viseu), [256]
but a law passed in 2008 abolished these, converting them into intermunicipal communities, whose
territories are (roughly) based on the NUTS III statistical regions. [257][256]

Immigration
In 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants, of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants. [259] In 2015,
Portugal had 10,341,330 inhabitants, of whom about 383,759 were legal migrants, making up 3.7% of the
population. [260] In 2017, Portugal had 416,682 legal residents of foreign origin, of which 203,753
identified as male, and 212,929 as female. [261] As of 2020, 32,147 residents of foreign origin acquired
Portuguese nationality, of which 17,021 were female and 15,126 were male. [262]
Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone
of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the
south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic
Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European
powers to give up its overseas territories (among them
Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the
administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at
Top origins for foreign-born naturalized
the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and
citizens of Portugal
been influenced by cultures from former colonies or
dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former
territories for both economic and personal reasons. Portugal,
long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), [263] has now
become a country of net immigration, [264] and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African
(Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated
800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in
1975. [263]
Since the 1990s, along with a boom in construction, several new waves of Ukrainian, Brazilian, Lusophone
Africans and other Africans have settled in the country. Romanians, Moldovans, Kosovo Albanians,
Russians and Chinese have also migrated to the country. Portugal's Romani population is estimated to be atabout 40,000.
Numbers of Venezuelan, Pakistani and Indian migrants are also significant. It is estimated that over 30,000
seasonal, often illegal immigrants work in agriculture, mainly in the south where they are often exploited by
organized seasonal workers' networks. The workers sometimes get paid less than half the minimum pay
established by law. These migrants, who often arrive without due documentation or work contracts, make
up over 90% of agricultural workers in the south of Portugal. Most are Indo-Asians, from India,
Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand. In the interior of the Alentejo there are many African workers.
Significant numbers also come from Eastern Europe, Moldova, Ukraine, Romania and Brazil. [265]
In addition, a number of EU citizens, mostly from the United Kingdom or other northern European
countries, have become permanent residents in the country (with the British community being mostly
composed of retired pensioners who live in the Algarve and Madeira). [266]

Influences from African Traditional Religion and
Chinese Traditional Religion are also felt among
many people, particularly in fields related with Traditional Chinese Medicine and Traditional African
Herbal Medicine. Some 6.8% of the population declared themselves to be non-religious, and 8.3% did not
give any answer about their religion. [267]
Many Portuguese holidays, festivals and traditions have a Christian origin or connotation. Although
relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable
since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the 13th and 14th
centuries, the church enjoyed power and close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the
foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including its first university.
The growth of the Portuguese overseas empire made its missionaries important agents of colonization, with
important roles in the education and evangelization of people from all the inhabited continents. The growth
of liberal and nascent republican movements during the eras leading to the formation of the First Portuguese
Republic (1910–26) changed the role and importance of organized religion.
Portugal is a secular state: church and state were formally separated during the First Portuguese Republic,
and this was reiterated in the 1976 Portuguese Constitution. Other than the Constitution, the two most
important documents relating to religious freedom in Portugal are the 1940 Concordata (later amended in
1971) between Portugal and the Holy See and the 2001 Religious Freedom Act.
Languages
Portuguese is the official language of Portugal. It is a Romance language that is derived from Galician-
Portuguese, which was spoken in what is now Galicia and Northern Portugal. There are still strong
similarities between the Galician and Portuguese cultures. Galicia is a consultative observer of the
Community of Portuguese Language Countries.The Portuguese language is derived from the Latin spoken by the
romanized pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula around
2000 years ago – particularly the Celts, [28] Conii, [268]
Lusitanians [27] and Turduli. [269] In the 15th and 16th centuries, the
language spread worldwide as Portugal established a colonial and
commercial empire between 1415 and 1999. [270] Portuguese is
spoken as a native language in five different continents, with Brazil
A sign in Mirandese in Miranda do
accounting for the largest number of native Portuguese speakers of
Douro, Trás-os-Montes
any country. In 2013 the Portuguese language is the official
language spoken in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, São
Tomé and Príncipe, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, and East
Timor. These countries, plus Macau Special Administrative Region (People's Republic of China) where
Portuguese is co-official with Cantonese, make up the Lusosphere, a term derived from the ancient Roman
province of "Lusitania", which currently matches the Portuguese territory south of the Douro river. [271]
Mirandese is also recognized as a co-official regional language in some municipalities of North-Eastern
Portugal. It is part of the Astur-Leonese group of languages. [272] An estimate of between 6,000 and 7,000
Mirandese speakers has been documented for Portugal. [273] Furthermore, a particular dialect known as
Barranquenho, spoken in Barrancos, is also officially recognized and protected in Portugal since 2021. [274]
Minderico, a sociolect of the Portuguese language, is spoken by around 500 people in the town of
Minde. [275]
According to the International English Proficiency Index, Portugal has a high proficiency level in English,
higher than those of other Romance-speaking European countries like Spain, Italy or France. [276]
Education
The educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age six), basic education (nine years, in
three stages, compulsory), secondary education (three years, compulsory since 2010), and higher education
(subdivided in university and polytechnic education). Universities are usually organized into faculties.
Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of Portuguese higher
education institutions.
The total adult literacy rate is 99.4 per cent. Portuguese primary
school enrolments are 100 per cent. According to the Programme
for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018, Portugal scored
around the OECD average in reading, mathematics and science. In
reading and mathematics, mean performance in 2018 was close to
the level observed in 2009 to 2015; in science, mean performance
in 2018 was below that of 2015, and returned close to the level
observed in 2009 and 2012. [277][278]
University of Evora, Portugal's
About 46,9% of college-age citizens (20 years old) attend one of
second-oldest university
Portugal's higher education institutions [279][280][281] (compared
with 50% in the United States and 35% in the OECD countries). In
addition to being a destination for international students, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for
international students. All higher education students, both domestic and international, totalled 380,937 in
2005.Portuguese universities have existed since 1290. The oldest
Portuguese university [282] was first established in Lisbon before
moving to Coimbra. Historically, within the scope of the
Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering
school of the Americas (the Real Academia de Artilharia,
Fortificação e Desenho of Rio de Janeiro) in 1792, as well as the
oldest medical college in Asia (the Escola Médico-Cirúrgica of
Goa) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the
University of Lisbon.

Lusosphere, degree owners from other institutions, students from
other institutions (academic transfer), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject
to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.
Most student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has
to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of
students (many as international students and part-time students or in evening classes) like employees,
businessmen, parents, pensioners and foreigners (most prominently from Brazil, [283] a Portuguese-speaking
country), many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses,
with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality
(teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).
Portugal has entered into cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other
US institutions to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and
research.
Health
According to the Human
Development Report, the
average life expectancy in
Portugal had reached 82
years in 2017; [284] in 2020 it
was estimated at 82.11
years. [285] As projected by
the United Nations, the life
expectancy of the Portuguese
population will be over 90
years when we reach
2100. [286] The trajectory of

the graph on the left.
Portugal ranks 12th in the best public health systems in the world, ahead of other countries like the United
Kingdom, Germany or Sweden. [287][288]
The Portuguese health system is characterized by three coexisting systems: the National Health Service
(Serviço Nacional de Saúde, SNS), special social health insurance schemes for certain professions (health
subsystems) and voluntary private health insurance. The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition,
about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and
another 7% by mutual funds.
The Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS. Five
regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives,
developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have
aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the
autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary
care.
The SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee
contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by
the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.

Similar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from
noncommunicable diseases. Mortality from cardiovascular diseases
(CVD) is higher than in the eurozone, but its two main
components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease,
display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with
cerebrovascular disease being the single biggest killer in Portugal
(17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in
the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A.
Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women
younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing
among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer,
cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent. Portugal has
the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp
increase since the 1980s.
Portugal's infant mortality rate is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.
People are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their
behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health, can
differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations.
Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at household level, complement other data on health status and
the use of services.
Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is
the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in
terms of mortality and selected morbidity. [289] Hospital de Santa Maria is the largest university hospital in
Portugal. [290]
CultureJerónimos Monastery (top) and Belém Tower (middle) are magna opera of the Manueline style and symbols of
Portuguese nationhood. Casa da Música (bottom) is an example of post-Millennium architecture.
Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilizations that have crossed
the Mediterranean and the European continent, or were introduced when it played an active role during the
Age of Discovery. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), Portugal modernized its public cultural facilities, in
addition to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation established in 1956 in Lisbon.
These include the Belém Cultural Centre in Lisbon, Serralves Foundation and the Casa da Música, both in
Porto, as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built or
renovated in many municipalities across the country. Portugal is home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage
Sites, ranking it 9th in Europe and 18th in the world.
Architecture
Traditional architecture is distinctive and include the Manueline, also known as Portuguese late Gothic a
sumptuous, composite Portuguese style of architectural ornamentation of the first decades of the 16th
century, followed by Pombaline style of the 18th century. A 20th-century interpretation of traditional
architecture, Soft Portuguese style, appears extensively in major cities, especially Lisbon. Modern Portugal
has given the world renowned architects like Eduardo Souto de Moura, Álvaro Siza Vieira (both Pritzker
Prize winners) and Gonçalo Byrne. In Portugal Tomás Taveira is also noteworthy, particularly for stadium
design. [291][292][293]
CinemaPortuguese cinema has a long tradition, reaching back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century.
António Lopes Ribeiro, António Reis, Pedro Costa, Manoel de Oliveira, João César Monteiro, José
Fonseca e Costa, Edgar Pêra, António-Pedro Vasconcelos, Fernando Lopes, João Botelho, João Mário
Grilo and Leonel Vieira, are among those that gained notability. Noted Portuguese film actors include
Joaquim de Almeida, Nuno Lopes, Daniela Ruah, Maria de Medeiros, Diogo Infante, Soraia Chaves,
Ribeirinho, Lúcia Moniz, and Diogo Morgado.
Literature
Portuguese literature, one of the earliest Western
literatures, developed through text as well as song.
Until 1350, the Portuguese-Galician troubadours
spread their literary influence to most of the Iberian
Peninsula, [294] like King D. Dinis (1261-1325) who
became famous for his poetry. Other kings would
write and sponsor works of literature across
Portuguese history, like D. Fernando (1367-1383)
who supported Pêro Menino in writing o Livro da
Falcoaria [82] . Another notable name in Portuguese
literature is Gil Vicente (c. 1465–c. 1536), one of the
founders of Portuguese dramatic traditions.
Luís Vaz de Camões,

Portuguese Renaissance
Fernando Pessoa,

century Portuguese
literature
Adventurer and poet Luís de Camões (c. 1524–1580)
wrote the epic poem Os Lusíadas (The Lusiads),
with Virgil's Aeneid as his main influence. [295]
Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles, as exemplified by Bocage
(1765–1805), Antero de Quental (1842–1891) and Fernando Pessoa (1888–1935). Modern Portuguese
literature is represented by authors such as Almeida Garrett, Camilo Castelo Branco, Eça de Queirós,
Fernando Pessoa, Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen, António Lobo Antunes, Miguel Torga and Agustina
Bessa-Luís. Particularly popular and distinguished is José Saramago, recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in
Literature.
Cuisine
Portuguese cuisine is very diverse. The Portuguese consume a lot of dry cod (bacalhau in Portuguese), for
which there are hundreds of recipes. Two other popular fish recipes are grilled sardines and caldeirada, a
tomato-based stew that can be made from several types of fish and/or molluscs with a mix of onion, garlic,
bay leaf, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, parsley or coriander. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of
beef, pork, chicken, goat, lamb, duck, include cozido à portuguesa, feijoada, frango de churrasco, leitão
(roast suckling pig), chanfana and carne de porco à alentejana. A very popular northern dish is dobrada, a
tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice. Peri-peri chicken is a spicy
charcoal chicken dish served with fries or rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most
common in the Algarve region.
Typical fast food dishes include the Francesinha (Frenchie) from Porto, "Tripas à moda do Porto" which is
also a traditional dish from Porto, and bifanas (grilled pork) or prego (grilled beef) sandwiches, which are
well known around the country. The Portuguese art of pastry has its origins in the many medieval Catholic
monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly eggs,
vanilla, cinnamon, flour, almonds and some liqueurs), managed to create a spectacular wide range of
different pastries, of which pastéis de Belém (or pastéis de nata) originally from Lisbon, and ovos molesfrom Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with
different regions having their own traditional dishes. The
Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country
there are myriad good restaurants and typical small tasquinhas.
Portuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the
times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god
Bacchus. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines
have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese
Pasteis de Nata in Lisbon
wines are Vinho Verde, Vinho Alvarinho, Vinho do Douro, Vinho
do Alentejo, Vinho do Dão, Vinho da Bairrada and the sweet Port
Wine, Madeira Wine, and the Moscatel from Setúbal and Favaios. Port and Madeira are particularly
appreciated in a wide range of places around the world.
Music
Fado, depicted in this famous
painting (c. 1910) by José Malhoa, is
Portugal's traditional music.
Portuguese music encompasses a wide variety of genres. The
traditional one is the Portuguese folk music which has deep roots in
local customs having as instruments bagpipes (gaita), drums, flutes,
tambourines, accordions and ukuleles (cavaquinho). Within
Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of Fado, a
melancholic urban music originated in Lisbon in the 19th century,
probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with
the Portuguese guitar and saudade, or longing. Coimbra fado, a
unique type of "troubadour serenading" fado, is also noteworthy.
Internationally notable performers include Amália Rodrigues,
Carlos Paredes, José Afonso, Mariza, Carlos do Carmo, António
Chainho, Mísia, Dulce Pontes and Madredeus.
In the classical music domain, Portugal is represented by names as
the pianists Artur Pizarro, Maria João Pires, Sequeira Costa, the
violinists Carlos Damas, Gerardo Ribeiro and in the past by the great cellist Guilhermina Suggia. Notable
composers include Marcos Portugal, José Vianna da Motta, Carlos Seixas, João Domingos Bomtempo,
João de Sousa Carvalho, Luís de Freitas Branco and his student Joly Braga Santos, Fernando Lopes-Graça,
Emmanuel Nunes and Sérgio Azevedo. Similarly, contemporary composers such as Nuno Malo and
Miguel d'Oliveira have achieved some international success writing.
In addition to Folk, Fado and Classical music, other genres are
present at Portugal like pop and other types of modern music,
particularly from North America and the United Kingdom, as well
as a wide range of Portuguese, Caribbean, Lusophone African and
Brazilian artists and bands. Artists with international recognition
include Dulce Pontes, Moonspell, Buraka Som Sistema, Blasted
Mechanism, David Carreira and The Gift, with the three latter
being nominees for a MTV Europe Music Award.
Portugal has several summer music festivals, such as Festival
Sudoeste in Zambujeira do Mar, Festival de Paredes de Coura in
Amália Rodrigues, known as the
Paredes de Coura, Festival Vilar de Mouros near Caminha, Boom
Queen of Fado, performing in 1969
Festival in Idanha-a-Nova Municipality, NOS Alive, Sumol
Summer Fest in Ericeira, Rock in Rio Lisboa and Super Bock Super
Rock in Greater Lisbon. Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed moreto an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto. Furthermore, one of the largest international Goa
trance festivals takes place in central Portugal every two years, the Boom Festival, that is also the only
festival in Portugal to win international awards: European Festival Award 2010 – Green'n'Clean Festival of
the Year and the Greener Festival Award Outstanding 2008 and 2010. There is also the student festivals of
Queima das Fitas are major events in a number of cities across Portugal. In 2005, Portugal held the MTV
Europe Music Awards, in Pavilhão Atlântico, Lisbon. Furthermore, Portugal won the Eurovision Song
Contest 2017 in Kyiv with the song "Amar pelos dois" presented by Salvador Sobral, and subsequently
hosted the 2018 contest at the Altice Arena in Lisbon. [296][297]
Visual arts
Domingos Sequeira was one of the
most prolific neoclassical painters.
(Adoration of the Magi; 1828).
Portugal has a rich history in painting. The first well-known
painters dating back to the 15th century – like Nuno Gonçalves and
Vasco Fernandes – were part of the late Gothic painting period.
During the Renaissance, Portuguese painting was highly influenced
by Northern European painting. In the Baroque period Josefa de
Óbidos and Vieira Lusitano were the most prolific painters. José
Malhoa, known for his work Fado, and Columbano Bordalo
Pinheiro (who painted the portraits of Teófilo Braga and Antero de
Quental) were both references in naturalist painting.
The 20th century saw the arrival of Modernism, and along with it
came the most prominent Portuguese painters: Amadeo de Souza-
Cardoso, who was heavily influenced by French painters,
particularly the Delaunays (Robert and Sonia). Among his best-known works is Canção Popular a Russa e
o Fígaro. Other great modernist painters/writers include Carlos Botelho and Almada Negreiros, friend to
the poet Fernando Pessoa, who painted Pessoa's portrait. He was deeply influenced by both Cubist and
Futurist trends.
Prominent international figures in visual arts nowadays include painters Vieira da Silva, Júlio Pomar,
Helena Almeida, Joana Vasconcelos, Julião Sarmento and Paula Rego.
Sport
Football is the most popular sport in Portugal. There are several football competitions ranging from local
amateur to world-class professional level. The legendary Eusébio is still a major symbol of Portuguese
football history. FIFA World Player of the Year winners Luís Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo, who won the
FIFA Ballon d'Or, are two world-class Portuguese football players. Portuguese football managers are also
noteworthy, with José Mourinho being among the most renowned.
The Portugal national football team – Seleção Nacional – have won one UEFA European Championship
title: the UEFA Euro 2016, with a 1–0 victory in the final over France, the tournament hosts. In addition,
Portugal finished first in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League with a 1–0 win over the Netherlands in the
final (held in Portugal), second in the Euro 2004 (also held in Portugal), third in the 1966 FIFA World Cup
and 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and fourth in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. At youth level, Portugal
have won two FIFA World Youth Championships (in 1989 and 1991) and several UEFA European Youth
Championships.
S.L. Benfica, Sporting CP and FC Porto are the largest sports clubs by popularity and by number of
trophies won, often known as "os três grandes" ("the big three"). They have won eight titles in the
European UEFA club competitions, were present in 21 finals and have been regular contenders in the laststages almost every season. Other than football, many Portuguese
sports clubs, including the "big three", compete in several other
sports events with a varying level of success and popularity, these
may include roller hockey, basketball, futsal, handball, volleyball
and athletics. The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) –
Federação Portuguesa de Futebol – annually hosts the Algarve
Cup, a prestigious women's football tournament that has been
celebrated in the Portuguese region of Algarve.
The Portuguese national rugby union team qualified for the 2007
Rugby World Cup and the Portuguese national rugby sevens team
has played in the World Rugby Sevens Series.
Cristiano Ronaldo is consistently
ranked as one of the best football
players in the world and considered
to be one of the greatest players of
all time. [298]

Portugal's paralympic athletes have also won many medals in sports including swimming, boccia, athletics,
mixed martial arts and wrestling.
In motorsport, Portugal is internationally noted for the Rally of Portugal, and the Estoril and Algarve
Circuits as well as the revived Porto Street Circuit which holds a stage of the WTCC every two years, as
well as for a number of internationally noted pilots and racers such as Miguel Oliveira, Tiago Monteiro,
António Félix da Costa, Filipe Albuquerque, Pedro Lamy, Armindo Araújo and others in a wide range of
varied motorsports.
In equestrian sports, Portugal won the only Horseball-Pato World Championship in 2006 achieved the third
position in the First Horseball World Cup and has achieved several victories in the European Working
Equitation Championship.
In water sports, Portugal has three major sports: swimming, water polo and surfing. Most recently, Portugal

the country also hosts one of the stages of the World Surf League men's and women's Championship Tour,the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal at the Supertubos in Peniche.
Northern Portugal has its own original martial art, Jogo do Pau, in
which the fighters use staffs to confront one or several opponents.
Other popular sport-related recreational outdoor activities with
thousands of enthusiasts nationwide include airsoft, fishing, golf,
hiking, hunting and orienteering.
Portugal is one of the world's best golf destinations. [299] It has
received several awards by the World Golf Awards. [300]
High-profile, successful competitive athleticism and sportsmanship
in Portugal can be traced back to the time of Ancient Rome. Gaius
Appuleius Diocles (104 – after 146 AD) was a noteworthy
charioteer born in Lamego who became one of the most celebrated
athletes in ancient history. He is often cited as the highest-paid
athlete of all time. [301][302]
