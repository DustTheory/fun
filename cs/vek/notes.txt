Let's start by implementing a bunch of vectorized algorithms in c++ to get better acquainted with simd instructions.
Try to implement:
Some basic string handling algorithms
Vector operations
Matrix operations
Process large text files in some way
Process large binary files in some way

After this, will determine what to build my language around.
Probably, just to learn simd very well, the compiler itself should abuse
SIMD a lot even when not necessarily good to do so, just for the hell of it.
Also the code will look pretty incomprehensible and scary which is always good.

Compiler should probably be limited to working with SSE4.1 and below, but target should reqire SSE4.1

String handling:

Algorithm 1:
Code: ./experiments/string_matching/0x80plAlgo1.cpp

Ported the AVX2 code from example to SSE4 because my laptop doesn't support AVX2.
Then added a slight change to align the buffer at a 16 byte boundary.
